The dining room is loud and crowded. We were seated in a corner and I was comfortable but my husband who is 6'3"" and large framed was quite uncomfortable. The noise level is chaotic.  You can literally brush elbows with the person next to you.

It is blocked off for pedestrians only, but the parking garage on Fore Street is nearby.    It is five star for food and service.   The mussels are the best we ever have, and we’ve had them all over the world.  You do have to like garlic, and we do.  The noise level and crowded tables brings things down a notch.

Our server, Kylie, was attentive, accommodating, and pleasant throughout. Cocktails were excellent. My husband’s appetizer of smoked mackerel over pea risotto was wonderful. I was surprised when my appetizer of prosciutto di Parma arrived, that it was merely sliced prosciutto on a plate without any accompaniment. I guess I was expecting some melon to go with it. Nonetheless, it was delicious. Both of our entrées, the branzino for my husband, and the sole francaise for me, were perfection. We finished the meal with two excellent desserts.

The only constructive feedback we have would be the swordfish my husband ordered was 1/2 inch thick so clearly had been portioned making the piece of fish so thin.  Perhaps a coat savings measure?

116,street and co.,2024-03-23,OpenTable Diner,New York City,3,2,4,5,My wife and I  were excited to go reading the reviews and after waiting over a month to reserve a table. I got the Branzino with Mushroom Risoto and my wife got the Linguine with clams. Both dishes disappointed. The Branzino was undercooked and spent my dinner removing bone after bone in my mouth. The risotto was flavorless and not done to perfection with hard pieces of the Arborio needing to set longer in broth. A lack of the mushroom flavor was even more disappointing.  My wife’s clams were the best part but the sauce was mediocre and the pasta was not fresh.  When you’re paying for forty dollar meals one would expect a well orchestrated dish.  We were hoping beforehand to try the other Street Restaurants but now we’re not sure we can spend that kind of money knowing it might be hit or miss for the price.,open_table

Very pleasant and welcoming staff, it was fun to watch them work as a team.  They had some great specials as well.  We tried the grilled octopus and it was amazing.  My wife had the broiled scallops which she loved and I had a special broiled seafood stew that had great depth of flavors.  

The only complaint was they are doing everything they can to flip tables in under an hour.  The one line I never want to hear in a restaurant is the chef wants all orders for dinner placed with the apps.  This automatically means they are going bring your dinner within a couple of minutes of eating  your apps.  We like to spend closer to 90 minutes when we are having a higher end dining experience, several tables around us came in after us and left before us.  We were there for about 80 minutes because we held off ordering our meals.  It was sad to see so many people spend so much and get rushed out the door.  I honestly think they should say on their website if they do not want anyone spending more than 60 minutes.",open_table

My husband went to pay the tab and they still wouldn’t seat us while he paid the tab.

They would not take our appetizer order without our full meal order.

I asked for a different dressing on my salad instead of the recommended dressing and was told “not sure they will do that for you”, he returned they can but dressing in the side which was perfectly fine.

Salads were great, mussels and octopus were also delicious.

My husband ordered the tuna rare which was cooked perfect but very small portions and even smaller side vegetable. My dinner (scallops and farro for $38) was ice cold but flavor was delicious.

We started with cold, fresh oysters that rivaled the best we've had, and followed with the cod special with stewed tomatoes and shrimp, and the Sole Francais.  Both were fabulous - sizzling hot (literally).  The lack of the 5th star on the atmosphere is only because it was a bit noisy as tables are close together and brick isn't a great sound attenuator.

Both were great. We ordered the Garlic Knots to share with our cocktails. Super garlicky and buttery and light as air!!! You must give those a try. I ordered the scallops, which were fabulous. My husband ordered the tuna which unfortunately was terribly stringy and practically inedible. When the waiter checked back to ask how our meals were, i mentioned my scallops were fab but that the jury was out on my husbands tuna and that the piece of tuna that he was served seemed not the best.

Atmosphere and Ambiance: Scales Restaurant, nestled on the historic Maine Wharf, exudes coastal charm. The moment you step inside, you’re greeted by the salty breeze and the rhythmic lapping of waves against the pier. The nautical decor, with its weathered wood and maritime artifacts, sets the perfect tone for a seafood feast.
Culinary Delights:
Freshness Reigns: Scales takes pride in sourcing the freshest seafood. From briny oysters to succulent lobster, each dish celebrates the ocean’s bounty. Don’t miss the Maine Lobster Roll—a buttery, perfectly toasted bun cradling chunks of sweet lobster meat.
Inventive Starters: The Tuna Tartare dances on your palate with zesty citrus notes, while the Grilled Octopus surprises with its tender texture and smoky flavor. Pair these with a crisp glass of white wine.
Main Courses: The Pan-Seared Scallops are a revelation—seared to golden perfection and served with a delicate saffron risotto. For landlubbers, the Braised Short Rib melts in your mouth, accompanied by truffle mashed potatoes.
Dessert Dreams: Save room for dessert! The Blueberry Cobbler captures the essence of Maine summers, and the Chocolate Torte satisfies any cocoa craving.
Service and Staff: The attentive waitstaff strikes the right balance—knowledgeable without being overbearing. They guide you through the menu, ensuring a memorable dining experience.
Sunset Views: Arrive early to snag a window seat. As the sun dips below the horizon, the harbor lights twinkle, casting a magical glow on the water. It’s a moment you’ll want to savor.
Final Verdict: Scales Restaurant is more than a meal; it’s a sensory journey. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply indulging in life’s pleasures, Scales delivers. Book your table, raise your glass, and let the sea enchant you. 🦞🌊",open_table

I made reservations at the bar as soon as our dates became available (2 months ahead). We were seated right away and our bartender, Guy, took excellent care of us. The place was buzzing with great energy.  We had a lovely bottle of Sao Joao sparkling Rose to start, plus a half dozen oysters. It is really cool when you sit at the bar that they just put ice in the trough in front of you so when it's time to clean up, they just whoosh the ice and shells down a hole in the counter. Also, they have a guy who is a ""master shucker"" who opens up oysters in no time. 
 We decided to order smaller plates and not a large meal, so we started off with the Ramp rolls. Oh my god they were good! Instead of getting dessert, we ordered another serving of the rolls. The Asparagus salad was dressed perfectly in a lovely lemon vinaigrette. The Tuna Tartare was so fresh, but preparation was just a little too much for us. It was hard to discern the tuna because the other ingredients were very flavor forward. Our seatmates offered a taste of their Brown Bread and it was fantastic.

623,scales,2024-04-14,WayneL,Boston,3,5,2,5,"This is our third time at Scales, so we’re very familiar with how the staff does their best to rush you through dinner to turn over the tables quickly. We’ve learned to order a drink. Almost finish it, then an appetizer…almost finish it, etc. If not, your appetizer will arrive after the first or second sip of your drink and you will end up with an unfinished cocktail, two bites of your salad/appetizer and the entree on the table getting cold. This actually happened the first two times we ate at Scales, but now we know better.
Last night, my wife, who has celiac and therefore must have gluten free meals, asked our waiter what was gluten free since unlike most menus these days, there is no GF, vegan, or vegetarian designation on the menu. His response was, “you can read the menu and pretty much see if anything is gluten free”! BTW there was one appetizer, two entrees and no desserts that were GF.
My son asked to have a baked potato instead of the fingerling potatoes that came with the halibut. Our waiter’s response…”no substitutions are allowed…I know, it’s crazy, but those are the kitchen’s rules”. Fortunately, my wife said how about you just bring him a baked potato and we’ll pay extra for it which he agreed should be acceptable. The charge was $12.50 on our $500 bill for four (4) people.
We won’t be back as there are just too many alternatives in the Portland area including Sam Hayward’s Fore Street where we have never encountered this pretentious attitude. Bye Scales.",open_table

For dinner we shared mussels which were the star of the evening - large & plump & on top of a garlicky broth that was delicious to sop up with the best bread ever from Standard Baking . We also shared the pork tongue appetizer, chosen for its novelty. The tongue had a deep, rich flavor & the potato latke it was served on was a marvel of crispy shreds. After much discussion we split the entree of spit roasted chicken wanting to experience the cooking method Fore Street is known for. I have enjoyed other entrees ordered in the past more. The white meat was a bit overcooked & the dish wasn’t remarkable. Our side of Brussels sprouts surprised us ; we must of misread the menu. The vegetable came shredded- we had expected roasted .

The menu has three sections and guest are encouraged to order 2-3 plates.
We had the “famous” Bread order which was amazing (liked but didn’t love  the butter but not the egg yoke spread, but the homemade bread is to die for). Followed by the Asparagus dish with foamy hollandaise sauce, the lobster agnolotti and the large last plate was the pork chop - which, while a little heavy of the fat content, it melted in your mouth and was seasoned perfectly.
Our waitress was friendly and helpful with dish selection. The wines by the glass were very good and good value. Overall, great food and wine, little pricy for the size of portions (except the pork chop), and a slightly limited menu. Give it a very good and we will definitely come back again.",open_table

The lobster agnolotti was dull and the over powering xo sauce didn't allow the delicate lobster flavor through but accentuated iodine of the lobster from over handling/age.

I started with the melon and heirloom tomato salad which is enhanced by a delicious and pretty generous amount of duck prosciutto - amazing. Had a bite of my friend’s grilled corn and butter lettuce salad, and I can tell you I’ll be ordering it (please let it still be on the menu) next time I come in.

Entree tastes were also shared - we couldn’t agree which was more delightful - the crispy Japanese eggplant (with accompanying grilled shishito peppers and cherry husk chutney) or the pappardelle all’amatriciana (with incredibly fresh chanterelles and basil as well as pecorino romano cheese). Both were just beyond tasty and again, I have to emphasize the freshness of every ingredient. 

We also shared a bottle of their South African Chenin Blanc and found it a great accompaniment to our food.

Had to go for dessert - a blueberry mille fois and a chocolate tart. Had we been alone in the room, there might have been some plate licking. Not really (but maybe). 
 
Also need to mention the service - helpful, friendly, informed and obviously big fans of the restaurant themselves. Atmosphere is conducive to a great dining experience (we were able able to have most of our meal on the charming outdoor patio, but staff quickly found us a table inside for dessert when it began to rain - thanks!

We walked in and there was no air conditioning in the main dining room and even though we asked the hostess she basically said it wasn’t getting fixed. So we had to request to sit in a cooler spot.

The bar service was unacceptably slow but moreover the meals that we had lacked complete flavor and innovation from our prior experience. It was clear to us that there had been a change in chef. Many of the items were called the same thing for example, the smoked Butatta, but we definitely not what we had enjoyed two years ago.

We we expected the flavorful fluffy light and airy focaccia of two years ago and we were served a flatbread with gooey cheese in the middle.￼

The $65 New York strip was fair at best, tough and thin. The bok choy that accompanied it tasted like dishwater.

We also had a rack of lamb that came with four small lamb lollipops, and the halibut was the size of a half a graham cracker and dry. we ordered a second round of drinks just before our main course and they never showed up and we had to request to take them off our order.

The waiter we had was fine but flat. Heard a waitress next to us explaining the menu, meal details and drink specials to another table; we got none of that from our waiter.

The food was good but the prices are high for what you get. Restaurant aesthetics are lovely. 

Last year we went to Scales for our anniversary and they had a note card with a lovely message, service was excellent and food was excellent. They made our night special.  That is what I hoped our experience would have been at Solo Italiano.

I followed that with the pesto handkerchief pasta which was tasty, but not the standout that I recall from previous visits.
We ordered two focaccia for the table and both (the pizzata and the pizza) were delicious. The winner of the night was my husband’s tortellini. Exceptional!

1679,solo italiano,2023-10-05,Kate,Boston,1,2,4,3,"I had heard so much about this restaurant however it turned out to be $577.00 worth of disappointment. We were a party of 6 however seated at a table that clearly could only seat 4 people. Two of us were seated on the ends of the table and there was a horizontal piece of wood preventing us from putting out feed under the table. My back was killing me. My husband equally unimpressed and he never complains about anything. The food was just okay. Nothing over the top and my shrimp was over cooked and for $38.00 one would hope for more than 1  1/2 shrimp. The portion size was not much so we filled up on bread mostly which by the way was excellent. We were celebrating an engagement and a birthday so I could not bring myself to fuss about the table or anything. I just kept thinking what's all the hype about this place? Scales Restaurant, David's, Street n Co and so many other places are a much better spend so I would suggest spending your money at somewhere else. I think the drinks were good but the alcohol pour were pretty light. As a pro they did send over a round of shots as an acknowledgement for the special occasions were were celebrating. That was very sweet and much appreciated. 

I did come home and read the reviews (after the fact) and anyone that gave this restaurant a low star was responded to by the owner who shot back with excuse after excuse and did not take responsibility for anything. I would imagine this will be the case with my review. This is an honest review so take it for what it is worth. I will never be back to this restaurant and we eat out often. With so many choices in Portland, don't waste your money. I did try calling the restaurant and thought I should bring to their attention our experience but it is really hard to get someone to pick up.",open_table

Paying $48 for one small duck leg was a bit unbelievable......they are so small that two would have been more acceptable.

Just a side of chard or spinach… broccolini, a daily vegetable of some kind. That’s the only thing that was missing. So many restaurants don’t get what my friends and I are always searching for - lighter food, salads with greens, with a side of veggies, not heavy, meat and potatoes. We got most of our wish.

This was on the eve of our wedding anniversary, which they acknowledged on a beautiful dessert plate. Megan was our server. She did the best possible job. She was knowledgeable, personable, attentive, and energetic. We started with a mackerel crudo, which was very good, and the tuna tartare (delicious and with a very creative presentation), which we enjoyed with a glass of Prosecco. For entrees, we each loved the seared duck breast dinner. It was outstanding! The wine list is very good; we shared a bottle of Amarone with the entrees.

Brian did a great job helping us out from behind the bar (ask him to make you his Mexican old fashioned!). All of the food was PHENOMENAL. Truly a five star experience. Felt like we were being treated to Michelin star or James Beard awarded food.

Would definitely return if we were in town again. I'm sure the menu changes, but you can't go wrong with anything. We had the esquites, the lobster tostada, and scallops to start. For our mains, I had the lobster linguine and my wife had the eggplant lasagna. Truly a great experience all around. We hardly took pictures because it was so tasty. We got the mango cheesecake at the end (AMAZING), and they put a candle in it for our anniversary. We lucked out finding a reservation open. Be sure to plan ahead.",open_table

We ended up sitting up at the bar and had a GREAT view of the chef owner and kitchen. The bartender / waiter was engaging and knowledgeable. The food was amazing and I loved the eclectic nature of its origins. The grilled Octopus w/ chimichurri sauce was incredible and the eggplant lasagna was both delicious and lighter than expected. The cocktail combinations were creative and tasty. Not being a dessert person the biggest surprise came from dessert. I never order dessert because I am a savory over sweet person but the bartender highly recommended the Dulche de Leche cake and it did not disappoint!!

2154,isa bistro,2023-08-19,OpenTable Diner,New York City,5,5,5,5,"11/10 highly recommend! The food was EXCEPTIONAL!

For starters:
-Peach crostini with blueberries and goat cheese. So good it could’ve been a dessert.
-Meatballs: tender, delicious red sauce. Very fresh.

Main course:
Bolognese: rich, hearty, perfect! Fresh Al dente tagliatelle pasta
Vodka Linguine: holy smokes, this was SO good! Beautiful linguine with a vodka sauce topped with the most scrumptious burrata. Basil olive oil drizzled around the bowl. I could only eat half. Cannot wait to have it for dinner tonight 😝

Dessert: 🥰🥰🥰🥰 We had the triple chocolate pie. Gluten free cookie crumb crust, mousse, ganache, caramel drizzle and topped with flakey sea salt. Might be the best dessert I’ve had in YEARS!

2250,n to tail,2020-03-06,OpenTable Diner,Boston,2,2,2,2,"Overall meh. The service was way too slow. Server was attentive at first and very kind, but seemed “in the weeds” when it was seemingly slow. Had to remind her a few times of things we ordered and hadn’t yet received. Empty cocktails, wine, Empty water glasses too often. Apps were great, KFC Bao, Spicy fried chicken, dumplings, edamame, seaweed salad. Bbq items were just okay. Veggies had 0 seasoning, just raw veggies. 👎 We waited on the rice and Ssam for way way too long. Had the meat and veggies long before. So it wasn’t a cohesive meal. Accompaniments were much too small to actually be shared between the 2-3 people it recommended. We’d try upstairs if we ever decide to go back. But not downstairs again, now do we feel the need to go again.",open_table

I can tell this will be a great Saturday night out experience; authentic Korean BBQ with a nice presentation.   Food quality appeared very high and the staff was friendly.   Only complaints is are the price and speed of service.   The bill for 2 people was about 140 (for one of the BBQ platters).   Also the service was very slow.",open_table

The cocktails complements our meal well, I had a drink with ginger and sumac, I forgot the name but I love the bitterness and tast of it, my friends had a Singaporean cocktail, which they enjoy well.

I wrote down that the reason for the booking is birthday, and did not expect anything much from them. When we arrived we were served with a complementary blueberry martini to toast for my friends birthday, that was very thoughtful and impressive. We ordered 3 appetizers the marinated tufo, sweet and sour chicken and seaweed burrata, and all are outstanding, the tufo was so flavorful and crispy at the same time, while the burrata was so refreshing with the seaweed pesto in it, the chicken was thinly battered and crispy and light and flavorful. We all decided to have the beef kimchi ramen for entree, and that was very good as well, the beef was very tender and melts in your mouth, the broth was not over bearing, and the noodles and vegetables are cook perfectly, the kimchi was light and not to strong, although I prefer my kimchi strong but my friend who was picky like it that way, so it was perfect. The cocktails complements our meal well, I had a drink with ginger and sumac, I forgot the name but I love the bitterness and tast of it, my friends had a Singaporean cocktail, which they enjoy well. After dinner the staff once again gave us a  complementary dessert for my friend birthday, a sorbet made with mascapone, and ube and coconut bits, which is to die for. It reminds me of my childhood ice cream in the Philippines, although I'm sure the staff did not know we were Filipinos , but the gesture felt almost personal and very thoughtful.

I wrote down that the reason for the booking is birthday, and did not expect anything much from them. When we arrived we were served with a complementary blueberry martini to toast for my friends birthday, that was very thoughtful and impressive. We ordered 3 appetizers the marinated tufo, sweet and sour chicken and seaweed burrata, and all are outstanding, the tufo was so flavorful and crispy at the same time, while the burrata was so refreshing with the seaweed pesto in it, the chicken was thinly battered and crispy and light and flavorful. We all decided to have the beef kimchi ramen for entree, and that was very good as well, the beef was very tender and melts in your mouth, the broth was not over bearing, and the noodles and vegetables are cook perfectly, the kimchi was light and not to strong, although I prefer my kimchi strong but my friend who was picky like it that way, so it was perfect. The cocktails complements our meal well, I had a drink with ginger and sumac, I forgot the name but I love the bitterness and tast of it, my friends had a Singaporean cocktail, which they enjoy well. After dinner the staff once again gave us a  complementary dessert for my friend birthday, a sorbet made with mascapone, and ube and coconut bits, which is to die for. It reminds me of my childhood ice cream in the Philippines, although I'm sure the staff did not know we were Filipinos , but the gesture felt almost personal and very thoughtful.

The cocktails complements our meal well, I had a drink with ginger and sumac, I forgot the name but I love the bitterness and tast of it, my friends had a Singaporean cocktail, which they enjoy well. After dinner the staff once again gave us a  complementary dessert for my friend birthday, a sorbet made with mascapone, and ube and coconut bits, which is to die for. It reminds me of my childhood ice cream in the Philippines, although I'm sure the staff did not know we were Filipinos , but the gesture felt almost personal and very thoughtful.

When we ordered cocktails we asked for the bread and scallops first. Before the cocktails arrived we placed the rest of our order. First, the avocado tostada and shrimp tacos arrived, then the bread and scallops then the corn tamale. So we had five dishes on the table while we waited for wine to arrive. We gradually went through those dishes and, almost done, asked about the lamb which we assumed had been forgotten. The server assured us it was coming and it did several minutes later.

Four of us ate dinner at Regards Saturday night & totally enjoyed our meals. We are adventurous eaters who love to try new foods. We cook gourmet meals for ourselves & friends & we want quality options. 

Our motto is that we don't mind spending a little more money, if the food is better than we would make for ourselves and or something we wouldn't generally take the time to prepare at home. 

Because, the food is influenced by Japanese & Mexican roots, we had to ""ask Siri"" to define many of the menu items, but that was fun too.

The cheese on top, the Caesar dressing, the tenderness of the cabbage and the aioli sorta dressing on the side with a hint of garlic and some heat; made this dish absolutely delectable. The hamachi collar with the charred outside and tender velvety meat wrapped in Bibb lettuce with the spicy sauce to scoop up - yum. Just yum, it was fantastic to perfection. I did not care for the pesky toe crab dish with the chewy rice; felt it lacked flavor although the husk cherry added to the needed boost and made my mouth appreciate it a tiny bit more. The corn dessert we got on a whim due to recommendation from our neighboring table, with the honeyed figs and corn ice cream was somewhat weird?? Not boring but different.

3480,regards,2023-06-03,NicoG,Boston,2,2,3,4,"The food missed the mark. Flavors in all the dishes did not seem balanced at all. The Hiramasa Ceviche was very fishy and had no delicate citrus elements  - basically chunks of unattractive fish that did not go down well.  The tortillas and miso butter - tortillas seemed liked they had been warmed and left sitting out resulting in chewy dried tortillas with flavorless butter served on the side.  The crab and rice dish looked hopeful, but started with some crab flavor and pieces, and ended with leftover rice and mayonnaise.  The shrimp tacos were underwhelming.  One piece of shrimp atop butter lettuce in a tortilla and drowned in a citrus vinaigrette and some sort of crema.  Overprices, for what you get, quality and flavor painfully lacking.  Our server was very nice, but checked on us way too often to be comfortable and by the end of the meal was MIA, we had to ask the bartender for our check and then after waiting another 15 minutes had to bring the check up to the manager to pay.

My greeting upon arrival was meh; the host showed little enthusiasm. And I was the first guest of the evening. Our server was very nice and attentive throughout.

The dim lighting was somehow sad. The outside tables don't reflect the inside prices. No one chose to sit outside, thought the weather was perfect.

Steak was very good but overwhelmed by mole sauce; the hamachi fish collar was delectable but it was too much effort to get to the meat. The radish-heavy scallops and martini didn't come close to those aforementioned establishments and were disappointing. We did mention to our server that one dish (sea bass) was way over-salted and we barely touched it but there it was on the bill. Oh well.  

Timing of everything seemed off, even with the trendy warning about dishes not coming out in sequence. I wish them sincere good luck.",open_table

They won't do any sort of substitutions, even for dietary restrictions/allergies, so you have to order a la carte. The exact same meal with fries substituted for the cheesy potato dish costs $18 more than the entree option. So they basically charge $18 for an allergy.

Our server was delightful and clearly knew the menu. Drink service was slow but the blue cheese stuffed olives are worth the wait. Apps were good, our party liked the mussels and the calamari, despite a very fiery hot chili sauce. Dinner presented well, the trout dish was well plated. My wife enjoyed her salmon as well. My steak, although requested medium was cold to the touch rare and needed to be returned. It was scraped off the plate and brought back to the grill. For a $50 plate, that felt sloppy. Overall it was good but not the level of finesse one would expect. The least appealing part of the night was the chef yelling at staff. He was clearly upset and it was quite evident in tone.

We were 10 minutes from our allotted time, and couldn’t linger over our after dinner drink.  Even if we wanted to shift over to the bar, there were no seats.

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and a cozy ambiance that instantly set the tone for a perfect night out.

The Grill Room offers a menu that exudes creativity and passion. Every dish we tried was a true work of art, beautifully presented and bursting with flavors that left our taste buds dancing with joy. From the perfectly seared scallops to the mouthwatering ribeye steak, each bite was a culinary masterpiece that showcased the chef's expertise and dedication to excellence.

Not only was the food impeccable, but the service was equally remarkable. The waitstaff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about the dishes they were serving. They seamlessly guided us through the menu, offering recommendations and ensuring that we had everything we needed to enhance our dining experience.

What truly stood out to us was the attention to detail and the use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The Grill Room takes great pride in supporting local farmers and fishermen, and it reflects in the quality of their dishes. Every ingredient was meticulously chosen, resulting in flavors that were vibrant, honest, and absolutely delicious.

The atmosphere at The Grill Room was also worth mentioning. The restaurant has a sophisticated yet relaxed vibe that made us feel right at home. The dim lighting, rustic decor, and soft music created a romantic and intimate setting, perfect for a special evening with loved ones.

As the night drew to a close, we couldn't help but feel grateful for the experience we had at The Grill Room. It was a wonderful reminder of how food can be an art form, and how a great dining experience can truly create lasting memories.

3842,grill room,2022-12-06,jcarrme,Boston,2,2,4,3,"We ordered an appetizer each. When was a green salad, that was fine. The other was escargot, they served it with grilled baked bread in the butter, they used to put on the bread was rancid. As a chef, I know rancid butter when I taste it. The escargot had no flavor to it whatsoever. Our steaks arrived. We ordered ribeyes, medium rare. We were asked to cut them to make sure that they were done to our liking. They were very very rare in the middle, and we sent the bat to be grilled again. When they came back with the ribeyes, they were black from being burned. It really ruined the flavor of the ribeye, but they were done medium rare. It’s been a year since we’ve been to this place and we went back to see how it is. It was the same last year, and it hasn’t changed this year. Displays could be a premium steakhouse if they just knew how to cook a steak",open_table

The Caesar salad starter was the only good thing about the meal, however, we were told there were not anchovies on it, but it had a couple large anchovies. The Management removed the entre from our bill, but at that point, it was too late and our anniversary dinner was ruined.  We had been the year prior and the meal was better but the French onion soup had a funky taste. Also, they typically have a gourmet burger, but it appears they have changed the bun (which previously was a nice dark house made bun), and the overall appearance did not look as good, so we did not order that which was also disappointing.

We’ve been going there for years and it’s always been good, but last night was really disappointing.  Service was fine, but the food was not good (almost awful). ￼My wife and daughter didn’t like their dinners (shrimp tacos with very little flavor and roasted Brussels sprouts smothered in some kind of cheese, a very unusual preparation).  But, it was my mushroom risotto that was the worst.  Rather than having the Parmesan stirred into the rice, it was simply a few shavings on top of what tasted like boiled rice.  I don’t think it was even Arborio rice. It was super bland (complete opposite of what risotto should be) and had hardly any mushrooms in it.  Honestly, I feel I could have made something better from a box for $3 rather than spending $27 on this.

4153,little tap house,2021-11-13,LisaA,Washington DC,1,1,2,2,"My husband and I went there after a long day of traveling. The restaurant was a close walk to our hotel and when we arrived we were seated immediately. That was the best part of our whole dining experience. We ordered Mussels ( fair)  very little broth but how in a town that prides itself on its seafood can you go wrong? We decided to get the Sloppy Joe sliders and Gnocchi. When the food arrived ( we waited way to long), My husband took one bite of the sloppy joes ( should name them sloppy nots) and made a face. My husband has the worst palate and eats pretty much everything, so seeing his face I was surprised. I asked what was wrong and he said it tasted like the chef dumped an entire container of salt in the food. I tasted it was gritty and full of salt.  He said he could not eat it. My Gnocchi was awful as well. It had a thick brown glaze that tasted like a very umami flavor gone wrong. The waitress tried to fix it by replacing it with a squash risotto. That was a mistake. The tiny squash boat thing was filled with an uncooked wet risotto that had the worst honey, syrupy drizzle that made it taste like a candy corn that had melted on top of it. The owner came over and acted like we were annoying her and would not even adjust our dining. We left hungry a hundred dollars poorer and annoyed. DO not go there go to the diner next door.",open_table

We sat at the chefs table / kitchen counter and had one of the most memorable experiences in a Portland restaurant. Chef David and his son Kyle worked together beautifully without having to say a word! My husband and I were mesmerized by the way they moved around in such small quarters. I can appreciate this immensely, as I am a private/personal chef, who never knows what kind of kitchen I’m walking into until I arrive. 
Having Chef David serve each and every course to use was such a wonderfully detailed touch. He described each dish with passion, educating each guest he served. Although it was Restauarant week, and a lower price point than usual, Chef David still created a menu that absolutely wow’d us. It wasn’t just dinner, it was an entire culinary experience that all chefs can appreciate.
 Often times you see chefs stressed out in the kitchen, irritated with one thing or another, bothered by guests or servers - but not here. Not one bit. He goes above and beyond to make sure his guests are happy, took time to chat and get to know my husband and I... we seriously felt like we had a private chef of our own for the night!  
Service was great, cocktails were delicious and the wine pairing was on point.

(Note: They also email the menu in advance so any allergies may be addressed- 48 hours ahead.)  All substitutions were equally as thoughtful and delicious as the main selections.  David found Maine wild blueberries at the farmer's market in the morning, where he finds his inspiration for the menus and featured them in at least 5 of the courses.

With 2 less courses and minus a drink to linger over, dinner was much shorter than I had planned. I was planning to be at Opus for two and a half hours minimum.

Only small negative is you pay for a serving of bread that is replenished but is for 1.  Two people? Two items. One for each. They don't necessarily strictly enforce it, but it is on the menu that way and if you both reply yes for the bread, you will be billed twice.

It seemed like most of the dishes were better than the ones that preceded the current dish, which makes for a great experience.   

The most memorable dishes of the night were the butter poached lobster and the tuna tartare, with the tuna tartare being elevated to a height far above almost any other tartare dish we've ever had.  It was so complex with so many layers of flavors, we were all just blown away.

The service was great as well.  They provided any and all information requested, and did so with humor and patience.  

The intimate setting of having only eighteen seats made it that much more enjoyable, as we felt comfortable, and it's great not having to talk over dozens of other people.

4423,david's opus ten,2014-09-16,Lincoln,Boston,1,2,1,1,"The memorable part of dining at Opus Ten was the sheer ridiculousness of the whole thing.  First, we arrived a little early for our reservation (found parking nearby) and we were asked to wait in the front room with no space at the bar and nowhere to sit.  Then we were led through the bustling, happy scene of the front to a windowless room in the back.  The room had been a largish coal bin with the coal delivery window merely  boarded over.  The conversion existed of adding a few tables, draping some cheap gauzy fabric in swags from the low ceiling, and adding a tiny kitchenette to a corner.  Though we'd had to wait 20 minutes, there were only 2 other couples in the dark, dingy space.  Not romantic, just dingy.  The rather mediocre food was served a by what must have been a first year acting student just learning her lines. Each tiny portion was described in detail, but  she could not remember to leave off the hated truffle oil. When the stinky dish arrived from the kitchen (elsewhere) and was sent back, we watched while the person in the kitchenette pushed off the truffle oiled salad on top of what-ever-it-was, replaced it with new greens and the server returned it.  Guess what still stank of truffle oil?  Moaning and grumbling the kitchenette guy went to get a new dish. We were amazed at the entire performance. Nothing was good, just verbosely described. The wine (more descriptions) pours were a couple of tablespoons at most and poured so slowly that they may have partially evaporated by the time she was done. We've dined at Michelin 3-stars and know what exceptional food and service are like.  This was a really bad joke!  An expensive bad joke.  And we wasted 1 out of 14 evenings in Portland on a bad joke. If this is David's ultimate, dream 'restaurant' we really don't want to know what his nightmares are like!  The whole experience was painful at the time, but in retrospect we see it as a Saturday Night Live performance and laugh.",open_table

The dishes were inventive, without being exotic, and the food was exceptionally well prepared. In particular, the lobster and oyster first course was exceptional. Chef Bo was friendly, informative and very talented.

Wine pairings are spot on--""reserve"" pairings are worth the splurge, but ""Opus 10"" pairings also great (we got one of each so we could try everything). While somewhat subjective, portions of food and wine are precisely enough for a tasting menu--less would be skimpy and more would be too much--when you get to the 7th wine you realize that while you may have wanted more of wine #3 or #4 because it was soooo great, it would have ruined you for the rest.

From sparkling to port, every pairing was superb - and we chose the lesser wines (we already knew most of the premium choices). Each course was a beautiful gem, and both of us ate the whole thing. Portions, of both wines and food, are reduced, but reduced to perfect. I was full after the brownie with flambé banana & ice cream, but not overstuffed. My favorite courses were the poached oyster & lobster served on the shell and the flawlessly flavored and cooked lamb medallion. We will be back every time the fixed menu changes...

My one gripe is with the service; the servers (there were only two the night we dined) have the same points to talk about prior to each course, and because it's a small area we heard the exact same thing each time a table's course was brought out. It creates a stilted feel to the service; like calling a customer service center and having the agent read a script robotically.

Every meal and side was prepared perfectly, the portions substantial, the seasonings balanced and interesting (and NOT oversalted, like so many places). Even the plates had been heated up, which is always a nice touch. The food and wine prices were right in line, being quite affordable in comparison to so many places these days. And after dinner, we closed out the check and our server said we ""had the table"" -- no push out the door, even though they were near closing.

The Front Room was the only one where we were successful getting a reservation for six people for a Thursday night with more than 24 hours notice.  Considering the cost of restaurant meals, this restaurant was reasonably priced--especially the price of a bottle of wine.
Staffing is also an issue everywhere, and there were clearly not enough servers here. 
But we were served fairly promptly.
The food was very good.  I had scallops, and asked the market price before confirming my order--$42.  It was listed as being on a bed of risotto, but it seemed that there were no more than two tablespoons of risotto with four scallops.  But it was sufficient for me, and very flavorful.

The schnitzel was perfectly cooked and crisp, but it had been covered with cooked red cabbage (kinda defeating the crispiness) and a scant amount of a mustard sauce.

There were supposed to be “crispy” potatoes but they had been buried under the schnitzel so they were mushy.

The fresh oysters were delicious.  I ordered the short ribs and they were done to perfection. However, the dish was void of any vegetable with the exception of a drizzle of squash puree.  Vegetables are popular right now and something green or perhaps some mashed potatoes would improve the dish.  A big solitary hunk of rib meat does not stand well alone.  My partner had the Spaghetti Squash ""pasta"" with mushrooms.  The dish was soaked in an overabundance of rich cream which made it way too heavy, a little goes along ways. Much too rich and it completely masked the flavors of the squash and mushrooms. Go easy on the cream or just do without.

We shared an order of specially seasoned French fries that were featured as an appetizer. They were dry and tasted like they had been lightly dusted with Parmesan cheese. Not worth their $15.00 price. Our main dishes faired better. The salmon was moist and delicious and the scallops were juicy and large. The three scallops were on a bed of risotto that was swimming in oil instead of a creamy sauce, which was disappointing.
Dessert was a underwhelming crème brûlée. Crisp but not charred on top and the flan had no flavor.

No salads to start.  The main dish of pork was excellent.  My wife literally had no choices that worked nor did her sister.  Not vegans, they chose vegetable lasagna.  In 37 years of marriage my wife has never chosen that.  She did given the limited choices.  Neither my wife nor her sister ate the dish.  I tried it.  It literally was tasteless.

Like many places these days they were seriously understaffed and the ones there were very stressed. The noise level was so loud we couldn’t hold a conversation. The worst part was the food- I ordered the pork and it was drowning in a cloying sweet sauce. I was struggling to cut it until someone came around to check and offered a steak knife.

 I started with a blueberry seltzer- it turned out to be a blueberry cider - the can didn’t say “seltzer” anywhere but the menu did. The online menu, which we viewed to make our reservations still listed the duck meatballs with whipped ricotta but the menu didn’t have them because the chef moved on and took the recipe with him. 
Our group ordered the poutine, the mussels, and the peppers with aioli for an appetizer.  The peppers were good, the mussels were great and the poutine was…not poutine. It was polenta fries. Which was fine because the menu said polenta fries but they were more like bricks. We then tried to order crispy chicken sandwiches and front room salads. They were out of chicken so we settled for carnitas tacos and steak. The pork carnitas were made of pork belly which was extremely fatty and the fat was not rendered properly, plus the pork belly was slightly cold. The tortillas were so strongly flavorful that they overpowered the rest of the dish. We each took a bite of our taco and didn’t finish. The salads were interesting but the dressing was under seasoned. The steak was cooked properly as ordered but not seasoned at all.

Food? well, it was fine except for the foreign object in the mashed potatoes...a hard, thick, mystery disk about the size of a quarter. I discovered it when I took a big mouthful. Disgusting. It was not organic, I know that.
I pointed it out to our waitress who said she would talk to the manager about it.

I decided to go back recently for dinner. Menu had changed. No brown bread. No local fish entrees other than mollusks - mussels in a soup or scallops only. I can't eat shellfish. So, I opted for a Reuben, the Front Room house salad and a side of roasted brussel sprouts. Sandwich was tasty. That was the one bright spot.

We started with mussels, the mussels were flavored well and had a delicious broth. The one piece of bread that accompanied the dish was limp and thin. The steak was ok, not well flavored but cooked as requested, the sides were delicious. Dinner #2 was a combo of 2 apps, the Parmesan risotto and the chicken lettuce wraps, what a let down. The risotto was a gluey salt clump, and I like my food salted, this was inedible, the lettuce wraps were greasy and the “pickled” carrots were limp matchsticks. Our third dinner companion had the French onion soup that was delivered to the table literally boiling and took close to 20 minutes before she could eat it, it was worth the wait, good flavor and savory. The goat cheese and beet salad was ok, not much flavor and the bland sherry vinaigrette did not dress it up.

So wonderful to see the chefs enjoying their evening as much as we did. Alexandra provided excellent customer service. Give her a raise. The only area for improvement would be for the hostess to remind those who linger after dining that there are those waiting with reservations. You require us to be on time yet let others linger to make us wait for our reservation. We watched. Your guests were finished. It was not cleaning protocols that caused the late table seating.

The  one letdown was the caesar salad as the dressing was very bland, there wasn't enough of it and we missed the lack of cheese on the salad.

4864,david's restaurant,2024-07-13,OpenTable Diner,Boston,3,3,4,2,"In the past, it has always been great to go to David's Restaurant for special occasions. I am a local foodie & cook, so going out to eat is treat. (I booked a table for two before seeing the Candlight Music show just across the street.)

Sadly, I was very disappointed with this last visit. It was a hot night, no AC, and the door was open. We were told the AC couldn't keep up. There was little air until the rain came an hour later.

Our drinks were good, although they were way over-priced at $14-19 for a glass of wine. We ordered 2 shrimp appetizers that arrived uncooked, not once but twice. It was removed from our bill. Instead, we ordered a mushroom tarlete that was fine, nothing special. It accompanied a Bruchetta that was not Mediterranean as listed but more Asian Fusion. It was soggy and crunchy from Seasame Seeds.

The staff was nice. The waitress tried hard and was responsive and apologized for the raw seafood. We appreciate that it was not her fault.

We shared our meals of Fried Haddock and a Lobster Roll, about $36+ each. The fish was good but a bit thin. The lobster was delicious and a fair amount on a toasted roll. They provided more mayo when requested. The side salads were fine but uninspired.

The worst part of my evening besides the shrimp was the kitchen cook yelling out for oder pick-ups every five minutes or so - like a short order cook in a diner. It was jarring and interrupted my fine dining experience.  There must be a better way. Pagers? I can't imagine how it was for the people at the bar surrounding the hot kitchen.

In their favor, they gave each of us a free dessert. One was a chocolate cake, and the other was a cookie and cream ice cream dessert, with coffees. The bill was over $200 (minus the shrimp at $36). We tipped her on the total.

I think it's getting harder to find a good, nearby restaurant with consistently good food that isn't way over-priced.",open_table

4867,david's restaurant,2024-07-09,divingann,Boston,2,2,1,3,"It was supposed to be a special evening with friends at David's.  Unfortunately, our experience at David's was terrible.  The most disturbing thing about the evening was our server.  He wanted to immediately take our dinner order before we even had our drinks or had ordered appetizers.  We felt like he was rushing to get us out of there.  Before we ordered anything we asked for separate checks (one for each couple).  He looked at us and said ""what? you want 4 separate checks"" (sarcastically).  We replied, ""no, we would like two separate checks, one for each couple"".  Then he asked again what we wanted for dinner - again, before we even received our appetizers.  Now for the food.  My husband had the haddock with green chile sauce - overcooked and dry.  My friend had a filet - cooked perfectly but almost inedible as it was so tough.  Another had the meatloaf which was fine.  Our friends ordered a ceaser salad - which they never got.  When they told the server that they did not get the salad - after their main course arrived, he argued with them saying ""are you sure, I'm sure I brought it to the table"".  Are you kidding me???  Did he think they hid the salad under the table? or ate it and disposed of the plate?  How absurd is that?  Then, the coup de grace - time for the check.  He brings it over and it is not in 2 separate checks.  He said ""well, just split it down the middle"".  Well we did not want to do that and told him when we first sat down.  He then basically said - too bad, we can't do that, you'll just have to split it in half.  Wow, wow, wow.  What a terrible, terrible evening.  We will never, ever go back to David's, even though they took the awful steak off the bill.  The restaurant was not overly busy, there were plenty of empty tables so there was no reason for the rushed treatment, and certainly no reason for the servers rude behavior, or the terrible food.",open_table

I don't know why I hadn't gone back sooner. The food was fantastic and the prices were on-par with most Portland restaurants. We started with the beef carpaccio and I'm kicking myself for not taking a picture because it was equally beautiful as it was delicious. The beef was shaved thinly, topped with arugula, capers, crostini and some lemony white truffle dressing that was out of this world. I had to stop myself from licking the plate. I ordered the spicy margarita which had just a hint of spice and didn't taste much like a margarita, more so like a lemon-thyme vodka cocktail. It was still good but not what I was expecting. I also had the cucumber basil smash which was light and refreshing. For my entree I had the duck breast over butternut squash risotto and sautéed spinach. The sauce of ""sherried plums and dates"" was the perfect accompaniment. All the elements worked beautifully together. The perfect balance of savory, sweet and tangy.

I ordered the margherita pizza, which was very salty and expensive ($17 for an individual pizza). We were happy with the wait staff. My biggest complaint is the 4% charge added to every bill to help cover the cost of David's utility bill. As disclosed on the menu, this 4% charge is to help defray the costs of David's electric bill so that they can pay their staff better. This is ridiculous. The restaurant is already expensive and the wait staff is tipped on the total cost of the bill. Is it appropriate to tip them 4% less, since they are allegedly getting the benefit of that 4% upcharge? While I understand that costs of ingredients have gone up in the recent past, these costs seemed to have stabilized and, presumably, David's has raised the cost of its menu items to account for inflation.

My friend had chowder, muscles and a chocolate cake (?) - and all was delicious.  I did try her desert  which was rather dense but very good.   She had some wine tooo - and was given 2 choices for the size, which is a nice option.  Our waiter was lovely, there when we needed him but not hovering and he had a nice sense of humor.

The downside for me was that we sat in front, which is by the windows and in front of the kitchen.  It tends to be noisier here but, also, you get the smells from the kitchen and leave with them on you!  I had made the reservation online and should have been more specific about where I wanted to sit since I couldn’t change it when I showed up.

Only one round of drinks offered. Caesar was mild tonight. Scallop and date app was delicious. For entrees, mushroom ravioli was amazing. Tuna was not as rare as I’d like (sitting too long?) and noodles were soggy. Haddock was delicious and fresh but blueberry compote was as sweet as blueberry pie, a strange paring.

The bruschette appetizer was very nice, a little more interesting than the usual. My duck was perfectly cooked with an unusual strawberry sauce I really liked. My husband had the tournedos au poivre which he loved. He doesn't usually order anything ""au poivre"" so I was surprised at how much he enjoyed this dish.

We started with drinks. I had the Spiced Coconut Punch..... delicious!!! My husband tried David's Boulevardier. He thought it was fantastic.

We shared a Caesar Salad to start. It was really good, dressed to perfection and a great starter.

I had the Tournedos au Pouvre. The dish was amazing. The peppercorns in the sauce make it a little spicy but it's fantastic. The veggies and potatoes that come with it, compliment the meat well.

My husband chose David's Meatloaf. It was as delicious as it looks in the photos. We were both beyond pleased with our selections and would 100% try this restaurant again if we return to Portland, ME.

We got a bottle of wine and an appetizer right away, ordered meal when wine came then shortly after appetizer came.  Then we sat for 40 min without our food being delivered, neighboring tables who were sat after us ordered after and received food.  waiter in 40 minutes did not come to check on us.  We were going to be late for our event so I got up to go tell our waiter that we still hadn’t received our food after 40+ minutes and we needed it packaged to go also need the check. Waiter did not say sorry, just he’ll have to looking into that.  Came over to our table 5 minutes later saying the kitchen did something with the ticket. I’ve waited tables quite a bit in my life and totally understand blaming the kitchen but this was so outrageous, the waiter had not been to our table to check on us in over 40 min, that’s on him. He by the way tell us he’ll get us to our show on time… yes only because I got up to say we’ve been sitting for 40 min, and we’ll go to the show without eating dinner.

6046,corner room,2024-06-08,OpenTable Diner,Boston,3,2,4,2,"We’ve loved this place for a long time, but hadn’t been in a while. Our most recent experience was  disappointing and left us questioning if we’d go back.

First, the food was sadly just ok. Not the stellar experience we’ve always had here. For instance, the homemade Mozzarella on our Caprese salads was rubbery and dry - just truly awful. We mentioned it to the server but she said that’s “just how it is” and they “make it in house”. She just walked away and didn’t offer to get us something else, which was disappointing. Also, who  runs out of focaccia bread at an Italian restaurant by 7pm? We were looking forward to it to accompany our apps. The worst was the negligence on the food allergy. My husband ordered the halibut fish special and shared his garlic  food allergy with the server. We asked for no pesto sauce on the fish but it arrived smothered in pesto anyway. It was so dark where we were sitting, my husband didn’t notice it right away and thought it was parsley garnish. He ate a good amount before he realized, but it was too late. He was sick for rest of the night.  No compensation was provided for the dish.

Food aside, our biggest regret with our experience was how the restaurant handled a patron slipping and falling  down literally all over our table filled with food and drinks.  The woman fell so hard, she spilled the entire contents of our table all over our laps. Our clothes were drenched. We managed to clean up the mess (mostly ourselves) but our clothes were all wet for the rest of the night.  We would have expected some sort of compensation for having to sit through the rest of our meal soaking wet, but all we were offered is another beer for my husband who had the most left in his glass when it happened. The rest of us just sat there and offered nothing. We expected maybe a free dessert or the manager coming over to apologize, but no one seemed all that apologetic for having our night and clothes ruined.

Overall, we expected a better experience.",open_table

The food is Italian- homemade pastas and delicious. We started with the arancini and each choose the orchichette with sausage. We chose the smaller size dish on the advice of our waitress Leanna as we were staying in a hotel. The portions were so generous we ended up with leftovers anyway which we made fit in the mini fridge it was too good to leave behind!

Two of us had the squid ink pasta was delicious with some spice but the menu said it has mussels and shrimp but we didn’t get shrimp in either plate.  I asked the waiter about this and he said that the menu only lists mussels.  When I got home I looked and saw that he was wrong.  That was a misstep on his part and disappointing for us as we would have enjoyed the shrimp especially considering we had already had mussels as an app.
Regardless of the one error by perhaps, a new cook in the kitchen, we had a wonderful dinner, loved our waiter and other staff that assisted him.  We tipped generously and will return when we are in Portland again.",open_table

The rating is due to several things; first, this nonsense of charging for bread is criminal, especially in an Italian restaurant.  It costs $1 yet you charge $8 and this was not even on the menu; the sourdough was but this was not what we got served. 

Also, the authentic Italian trattoria, we paid for a side of pasta yet the size of what we received was not $8 worth; the pasta plate, although they weren't run of the mill pasta was twice as much and probably was.  

I don't mind paying for good food or items made onsite but isn't this why I am dining out? There are somethings that have gotten out of hand and raking your customers over the coals is not cool.  While Portland, ME has come of age of late, just remember when the freight train is done, they will wonder why things become a wasteland.

There were a few negatives that lowered my rating: It was VERY loud which made it tiring to chat across the table. The lowest part of the meal was the time it took to get served. Between appetizers and main course, we waited over an hour. That meant that one of our party missed the ferry and had to take a later one. The other negative was the smoke from the kitchen which stung our eyes and left our clothes smelling strongly. 
The service was good in that our server was pleasant, and gave honest and helpful advice.

Our server was super attentive and helpful. He let us know he does not typically work at that location, but you would have never known. Drinks and Food came out quick and we’re all great. We got the whipped ricotta bruschetta to start. Large portion for just two people but super tasty and would definitely recommend. My husband got the spaghetti and meatballs and I got the pappardelle and mushroom dish. Both chose the smaller portions and we were stuffed. 

The restaurant was extremely warm due to the open kitchen. They propped open the doors to help with the airflow which definitely helped, but I recommend not wearing a long sleeve shirt there.

6287,corner room,2022-10-02,OpenTable Diner,Boston,5,5,5,5,"I picked the corner room for my friend bachelorette party in Portland after reading reviews on the Internet about the restaurant. Booking the reservation on OpenTable was super easy. When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a lovely host and we only had to wait like 10 minutes for our reservation. The place was super quaint and adorable with beautiful, ambience and decor not to mention the most beautiful fresh flowers I’ve ever seen in my whole life. Our waitress was amazing and very detailed and super bubbly and fun. We ordered espresso martinis, Caesar salad and for our entrées, I had the most amazing mac & cheese ever had in my whole life. My friend had the chicken Parmesan, which was equally incredible, and my other friend had a squid ink pasta dish. I tried every single item and the food was literally out of this world good. The last part was dessert and we got tiramisu, which was also equally incredible when it came time for the check, the waitress explained to us that they were comping our cocktails due to the wait for them being longer than they would’ve liked. We were having such a lovely time, We didn’t actually even notice the wait for the cocktails, but I told the waitress that I have never had that kind of service or incredibly kind gesture at a restaurant ever. I will most certainly be visiting Portland again we had such an amazing time. However, if you’re thinking about going to the corner room just do it you will not regret it.

The food was plentiful and tasty. Our waitress was doing the best in a difficult situation where she was clearly overworked.

The real distraction was the ambient noise level. Since the restaurant is housed in a relatively narrow space but with very high ceilings to call the Corner Room loud was an understatement. You could not hear the other members of your party even though you were sitting in a booth together. 

And for some inexplicable reason pop music was being blasted at almost maximum volume. I requested that the music be lowered and it was. However it was turned back up to it's original volume about 5 minutes later.

Service from our service was pretty lousy, a bit of a wisecracker - sort of an East German approach to customer service., grumbly, cut us off when we asked questions, almost broke the wine glasses as she seemed to almost slam them on the table. We should have none that this would set the tone for the night. The food was overall disappointing. Mussels which we shared as an app were excellent so the meal felt promising but quickly went downhill from there. My chicken parm was oversized, and generally unremarkable. I kept thinking “is this better than something I might pick up pre made at Hannafords?” Probably not. It’s like they were trying compensate for it being mediocre by serving a double portion. My wife pizza was as she described it - basically inedible - chewy, and doughy and served almost like a salad with prosciutto and greens piled on so high you had to dig thorough it to cut it. Again it was like they were trying to hard to present something that looked appealing versus focusing on the food itself. Our third diner had a mushroom something or another. This was literally just a half bowl meal. There was zero depth to this, it was like being handed a bowl of porridge. I hadn’t been there for about 7 years so thought we’d give it a try again, I guess I had forgotten why we hadn’t been for so long. The only good news is that for three people, a shared app and a bottle of wine it was just over a hundred dollars. So for three in Portland it wasn’t expensive but then again we all thought the food was pretty basic so for basic food it was expensive I guess. Won’t be going back there.",open_table

6421,frog and turtle,2024-07-11,MelanieL,Boston,4,3,3,5,"We've been eating here for about six years and unfortunately the quality of the service (and sometimes the food) keeps decreasing. We showed up at 7pm on a Thursday night expecting live music, but no band showed up. Okay, no problem - bands cancel - and the restaurant was basically empty (maybe two tables plus a handful of people at the bar) so we knew we wouldn't wait too long for our food, which has been an issue in the past. 

Our charcuterie plate appetizer was fine (great pickled veggies) but the brie was clearly old (visibly dried out except in the very middle). For my entree, I specifically asked our server if the seafood chowder had pork in it and she said yes, it normally does, but they could make it without pork as they cook everything to order. Great! I ordered a bowl of seafood chowder specifically with NO PORK. Unfortunately, it arrived *absolutely loaded* with pork. At this point we did not want to wait for another bowl to be made from scratch, as my husband's pizza was already on the table, and the pork thing is not an allergy just a dietary preference - so I picked out all the pork and piled it on a plate next to the bowl. Server didn't notice (even when she cleared the table) and we didn't call attention to it, because by then we were more than ready to say goodbye. I haven't given up on this place but wow, what a difference six years can make, based on the last few times we've eaten there.",open_table

After telling the hostess that it was a reservation for my elderly mother’s birthday, she initially sat us near the door and immediately adjacent to the bar. Very cold and noisy.

6468,frog and turtle,2023-12-29,DannyL,Tampa,1,1,1,4,"We had a 6:45 reservation on Friday 12/29/2023.  We used to go frequently over the last 7-8 years but had a bad experience in early 2022 for my wife’s birthday, and haven’t been back until last night hoping things had improved.  Last night we ordered drinks and then an appetizer, Brussel sprouts, and then our server asked if we wanted to put our entrees in.  We said no not yet and his response was “well if I don’t put it in now, it will be a while but up to you”.  So I ordered the beef Wellington and my wife ordered salmon.  As the server walked away, I asked if I could choose how the steak was cooked and was told “it’s all medium”.  The appetizer was good but my wife had to flag down our server after a bit for another glass of wine. Our food came out and my wife immediately noticed the salmon was under cooked but said she’d just work around it.  My first couple bites of the Wellington were good, but then I cut a piece off for my wife and notice it was pretty rare.  When I looked at my piece, it was raw.  I would prefer to order steak rare and even this was well
Below that.  It again took a bit to get our servers attention and when I pointed I out the raw steak, he kind of stood and just stared waiting for us to say what we would like.  I asked if they could throw it back on for a few minutes and that I didn’t even want a new one.  He came back after a minute and put the same steak back in front of me and said “so he won’t do it” referring to the chef.  I promptly replied “then I am not paying for that.”  He nodded and said “I’ll see what I can do” and left us for another several minutes.  Another man appeared and started clearing our plates  My wife told him to leave it, as we were waiting for a manager.  He introduced himself as a manager, but did not say his name.  He removed our food and nervously apologized and were not 100% sure he was a manage, as our server looked more professional than he did.  The steak was removed and safe to say we will never be back.",open_table

My only area to improve on an otherwise excellent meal and experience was that I ordered my salmon well done and I don't think it was cooked as well as I had hoped/ expected. I ate the edges and more cooked areas and took it home and heater it long and ate it happily - just would have liked it to be cooked a little longer at the restaurant. Waitress was extroverted and checked in plenty. Food came in good speed. Loved the charcuterie board as usual and the autumn- flavors in my salad and salmon were tasty, particularly the pumpkin in the salad it was delightful and soft.

First the good: The doughnuts. The simpler, the better and they are outstanding. Don't fancy it up with the Boston Cream Pie, or chocolate sauce.
The creton, on our sandwich was excellent. But the sandwich--really every dish in the place, was too big. And brunch isn't really a dish that you can take home if you can't eat it all. Eggs don't travel or hold well. Delicious food, but too much of it. It's wasteful, or it's a contributor to America's obesity problem.
We asked for bacon ""really, really, crisp."" We made a point of this. The bacon arrived translucent.  When we made the reservation, we requested a table on the roof deck. We couldn't sit there because a wedding the night before didn't clear out until 2am, and they didn't have the staff to clean it up for brunch service.  Sitting inside is not for hard of hearing.

The sound from the band and the other diners  swirled around this small room making hearing my husband and the waiter impossible. It was actually quieter in the nice main room even tho it was closer to the band. The small side room was so poorly lit, we had to use cellphone flash lights to read the menu.

We looked at the menu online before arriving and were looking forward to their steak and seafood entrees. We discovered upon arrival they pared down the menu to just soup, salad, sandwiches and flatbreads—not what we had hoped for. The menu was pared down to make it easier to get food out to customers on such a busy night.

The other person in my party was finally able to catch someone's attention to ask for one of the four already cleared tables that appeared ready to be seated. With a huff, she seated us. Another 20 minutes goes by and I had to reach out to touch the arm of a passing server to get his attention so we could at least put a drink order in. Another 20 mins later, my friends drink arrives and was not even close to drinkable. Pure alcohol. Great entertainment (why we went). Food was ok, nothing special. I feel like our experience might have been better had they not been so overbooked. It seemed as though staff were not prepared for a large private party AND the crowd that the entertainment drew. Probably won't go again unless the entertainment draws us, definitely won't order food unless it's a quiet night. Kinda bummed about the whole experience but at least the music was excellent.",open_table

I realize that all restaurants are struggling to find support, but waiting 75 minutes to get our breakfast is too much of a wait. It is even more challenging when you have a toddler. When our food finally arrived, it wasn’t hot, the order was wrong, and part of our order was missing. We ate the order as is because we were hungry. We asked our server for additional napkins 3 times and eventually I had to go get them myself. 

Also, the table we were sat at shouldn’t be a table. It is very cramped in that corner and you are sitting right on top of the other table. It made it worse that we had a high chair at our table, but I had called the night before to make sure it was okay to have two adults and a high chair at our table.

While we were walking up the stairs to the dining room I used the hand rail briefly and noticed that it was very sticky and not in just one spot as I needed to use it again and the same slimy sticky mess was noticed.
We were seated next to the bar at a wobbly bar style tall table which was quite off putting. It was busy and no other tables were available otherwise I would have kindly asked to move. We ordered the donuts which were excellent and they came out relatively quick along with a cocktail. My guest ordered just some bacon and home fries and I ordered the Jimmy Benedict. We waited approximately an hour for our food to arrive but my Jimmy came as a Franco American? After trying to put it on other peoples tables first the waitress then came and asked me if it was mine and I clearly didn’t order that dish. She apologized and asked me if I wanted it. I was calm and just asked her for what I originally ordered. My guest ate while my order was being remade. Finally my food arrived and I was able to eat but my guest was waiting for me to receive my food and hers was ice cold by then. Her side of bacon was dangerously undercooked on one half and burnt on the other end. My Benedict was not what I aspected from this restaurant. The Jimmy comes with caramelized onions which is fine however that’s all that was under the egg with little to non existing bacon.

We had the seasonal crepe dish with chicken and mushrooms, the Smokeshow burger with onion rings , a side salad, and dessert. Everything was fresh, cooked properly, well-seasoned, and beautifully presented. Cocktails were well-crafted and delicious. Dessert was BEAUTIFUL. 

The service? Fantastic. Our server was extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, and provided us with excellent service and menu recommendations.

The atmosphere? It was live music Friday and it was LOUD. Extremely loud. Loud to the point that we couldn’t hear our server, couldn't carry on a conversation, and for some portions of the evening I needed to pop in ear plugs because the volume was actually hurting my ears. The band’s musicianship was good but the acoustics of the dining room were far  too bright for a drum kit and electric guitars amplified to that volume.  It was such a relief when the band packed it in for the night and we could actually chat with each other during dessert.

I wondered about this when servers at tables surrounding us mentioned all three specials and later brought it to our servers attention. He apologized and said he missed a meeting so only knew of one special. Nice kid, but that’s not a good excuse. Then there was a cheesecake on the menu which we would have ordered for dessert around 5:30, but even though said cheesecake was served to a table beside us we were told it would be at least another hour before it was fully set. So that was a disappointment as well because we were told it was not available at that point. Seems like there could have been better planning since they open at 4:30 for dinner.

However, our server was practically MIA. The food runner dropped out donuts and ran. After breakfast arrived, I asked for jam, but she never came back. And none of that was the end of the world (I was just happy to see the restaurant was busy!) What was off putting is that after we paid the check, someone from my party got up to go to the restroom. While we were waiting for her to come back so we could all leave together, we were told we needed to “wrap it up and move on” so someone else could have the table.

The past few times we have been however the music was abusively loud. In the summer they could accommodate us on the deck and we enjoyed our meal. Last night the hostess just said “This is the best I can do.”  We were 6’ from the band’s amplifier and my wife was blinded by the stage lights. We left without ordering a thing and were really disappointed to have driven a half hour to find a restaurant that just isn’t about the food anymore.

Their menu used to brag about everything being made to order and encouraged you to settle in. Their bar program and menu are creative. The kitchen is legit talented. We used to love F&T and now we just can’t eat there. Guess we’re cranky old 40-something’s but we’re also a $200 two-top on a typical date night.

First the waitress brought me the wrong beer, no big deal but….. we ordered and noticed many of the folks around us did not have food. A few minutes later she returned to inform us the burger I ordered was not available as they ran out of burgers!!! She brought the menu back and I picked out an entree, an eggplant one. She never mentioned  that they still had chicken sandwiches which was my bad, that is what it should have subbed for the burger. She said the kitchen was ‘slammed’ just earlier. But this was 6:30pm on a Saturday. Took well over an hour for the food to arrive,
It was good but overall disappointing.",open_table

6686,frog and turtle,2022-08-12,Davidson,Boston,1,1,1,1,"We had a 6 person reservation for 7:15pm. The server came over within the first 5-10 minutes after being seated. We were given glasses of water, then our drink orders were taken. Waited 20 minutes for 2 drinks, an additional 10 minutes for 3 drinks and a total wait of 50 minutes until the 6th drink came out, which was sitting at the bar already made and ready for about 20 minutes. 
We asked the server how long for food and she said 25 minutes. At 7:56pm we order our appetizers(cup of chowder, pork belly, and fried calamari) and meals at once(2 ribeyes, 2 chicken, 1 salad, 1 bowl of chowder). 
At 8:35pm our appetizers came out and we were told our meals would be out in a few minutes. At 9:00pm we asked for the kitchen to box our meals and also asked for our check. (We had reservations elsewhere at 9:30pm.)
The server was paid and our boxed meals came out at 9:08pm. 
With all of that being said, we were there for 2 hours. And didn’t even receive our meals in that time. 
Now I’m not one to write reviews but, I have never waited 2 hours for a meal. I have never had a server who doesn’t check in on their table. I understand completely if it’s a lack of staff issue, but a little heads up and honestly goes a lot further. Safe to say I will not return.",open_table

The first person in the group arrived just before 5:30 and was seated. She ordered a drink while waiting for us to arrive. We arrived at 5:40 and didn’t see the server for 15 minutes. He finally came over and took our drink orders and 5 minutes later he came back because he forgot the orders. We waited for at least 20 minutes before the drinks came. The drinks arrived and we ordered a second round of drinks plus our food.  The drinks came out right away this time and at 6:55 we asked for our food to be changed to take out. We then watched our food be brought outside to another table and then they realized it was our food. We then had to wait for the to go containers and our bill so that we could leave to get to the movie. The restaurant was clearly short staffed but this was still incredibly slow. The food was pretty good but not hot. In hindsight, we should have allotted a little more time but we thought Wednesday at 5:30 wouldn’t be too busy and it wasn’t that busy. There seemed to be a private event of some sort going on upstairs which may have slowed things down too but overall very disappointing.

I get there a ""gastro pub"" but w/ not being that busy 3 hrs for food is not impressive.  This has been the 4/5 time we've tried Frog and Turtle and not impressed as there is always an issue and that service sometimes is not great as they make you feel like your beneath them.  I have been in the restaurant industry for over 25yrs and have worked at some very well known places with in Maine, and I know what to expect and have a lot of understanding esp with what is happening in the past few yrs, but I will NOT ever go back to F&G as what we had last night was unacceptable.",open_table

6705,frog and turtle,2022-06-29,AmyS,Boston,1,2,1,3,"We’re long time customers of the Frog & Turtle so our recent experience was deeply disappointing. From start to finish - it was a disaster! Two of us got there at 6 to have a cocktail before the other 2 in our party arrived.  We were sat & ordered cocktails right away. The other 2 in our party got there at 6:30 & we hadn’t even got our drinks yet (30 minutes to get 2 cocktails??). The restaurant wasn’t busy - when we arrived, there were 3 tables downstairs, 2 upstairs & 4 people at the bar. When our 2 drinks finally came, 1 of them was wrong (mojitos don’t have ginger beer!). The rest of our party ordered their cocktails….and 10-15 min’s later, the trainee helping our waitress came over to get their order AGAIN b/c our waitress hadn’t had time to put the order in yet (and clearly forgot what the order was!).  We’re used to waiting for food at F&T….it’s made from scratch & usually well worth the wait!  We waited longer than normal for our app (20 wings) and longer than normal for our meals. 2 of our 4 meals came incorrect (with mushrooms after requesting no mushrooms - we HATE mushrooms) & with stone cold onion rings.  When telling the server abt the 2 incorrect burgers, she said “if you’re not allergic to mushrooms I would eat them as it’ll be another 30-45 minutes to replace them”. So we unhappily picked our meals apart (mushrooms were encapsulated into the melted cheese) & ate what we could. When we finished, our waitress brought us the check & didn’t even ask us if we wanted dessert, another cocktail, etc.  My wife went downstairs to speak to a manager abt our experience. Our concerns were brought to James (owner/chef) who refused to do anything abt it. She was told “our policy is if someone takes a bite of their meal, we won’t do anything abt it.”  We ate the wrong meals at the server’s suggestion after having an entire evening of ridiculous wait times & wrong drinks/food showing up….and they refused to offer us anything. $200+ for a horrible experience!!!!",open_table

We love trying new restaurants. But I didn’t want to try a new one on this date night (which we never get, due to kids) I wanted to go to the place that was the best ever!!! Our waiter was clearly new (which was totally fine, he was great) It was the fact that he wasn’t getting any help. Thankfully the man (whom I think was the dishwasher, finally asked us if we wanted bread) Sadly everything I wanted you were out off. Which was fine because my dish turned out great. The one thing I came for was the poutine and it was inedible…. Thankfully it was taken off our bill but I was so sad. It was the best poutine we had ever had.

So I know that they have live music and I have been around this kind of thing all of my life and I'm not an older person so I can hang with the best of them, but there is a difference between concert levels and restaurants with live music levels, the PA system needed to be at least 30% lower to allow for most of the patrons whom were not there for the music to actually be able to have a conversation without screaming. On top of that we were told that the ""kitchen works best if you put all of your food in at once"" which didn't work for us since we were waiting for our third to get there and we just wanted to order a cheese board while we waited. It took 40 mins to get the cheese board and then another 40 mins to get our food, chicken wings and salads. So it was a bit of a mess. I have heard great things about the restaurant but I don't know if I'll try it again and like I said I have been around live music in every kind of venue since I was a child since my parents are in the music business and it's too loud if you leave a fairly small restaurant with your ears ringing.",open_table

This particular visit included good food but the service was terrible. We waited 25 minutes before our waiter came to the table. He did apologize. We have both worked in restaurants and understand that everyone has a night.

However, it may be time for them to think about the layout of the restaurant and what is serving what purpose. For example, we were there for a nice dinner, we were on the first floor where a very loud band was playing feet away and we could not hear ourselves talk. Additionally, the service was VERY slow, we were there for nearly 3 hours. We get that orders are hand-made and a wait is expected, but it seemed excessive. Our waitress was fun and lively and she did her best. I worry about how many tips these folks can get if the tables are not even turning over.
Maybe the music and pub food could go upstairs? and quiet dining downstairs? or vice versa? just a thought!

The grilled octopus was also tender with a crispy exterior, and the grilled shrimp with pickled onion and chimichurri were fantastic. One note: if you plan to share, do ask about how many pieces there are per plate, because it varies. The wine selection is terrific and less per glass than most places in the same category.

Once a server came, she notified us that they were out of two items on the menu already, at 7:30 on a Thursday night. My partner ordered a beer, and the server apologized and said they were out of it.

We finally managed to get drinks and a couple of appetizers. One of the appetizers was tasteless, literally. Just bland nothing. And when the server came back to get our entree order, my partner's first choice was also now out.

We paid the bill and left.",open_table
6849,local 188,2023-09-29,Erin,Boston,3,3,3,5,"Been to Local 188 a couple of times. Dinner last night was just okay.. 

Pros: 
-The atmosphere is great. Dim lighting, eclectic decor, cozy vibe, and it's always busy making it a great place for any occasion, ambiance-wise. 
-Great cocktails, beer and wine selection.
-Servers are pleasant

Cons:
-I wasn't impressed with the menu. We ended up ordering four things to share of which two were good and two were not - The sour dough bread was undercooked and the beef skewers were overdone and not great. The shishito peppers were delicious and the market salad was great.
-Our waiter was very nice and pretty attentive, however it was very obvious that the food runners had no clue what they were doing. Our salad came out before our drinks, which I think I can confidently say is the first time I've ever been served food before a drink. The woman who brought out our shishito peppers asked us if we ordered green beans to which we replied no and watched her walk around asking all the tables around us if it was theirs with a dumbfounded look on her face... Finally I flagged her over and asked if it was shishito peppers. Our beef skewers came out after we asked for the check. The entire night I watched as multiple tables around us were brought the wrong dishes...

Overall I'd say I probably won't be back and will instead when I come to Portland try to book dinner reservations earlier at a more reputable place so that I can get in!",open_table

We sat on the patio and Bri took care of us, as well as many other members of the staff. Everyone was so friendly  and accommodating. We are both gin drinkers and started with the Ruby Honey Jam and the Electric Daisy, made with their house-infused gins, they were perfect. We wanted a little bit of everything, so we ordered the mussels, hummus and flatbread, deviled eggs, and gnocchi. The food was delicious and the portions were perfect to share. We resisted the urge to drink the white wine garlic sauce from the mussels and instead soaked it up with the homemade bread and butter. (You’d want to drink it too, it’s that good!) We were too full to have dessert at the restaurant, but decided to take home a flourless chocolate torte and cheesecake with homemade raspberry compote, don’t judge, we came to eat!

7062,local 188,2021-03-14,OpenTable Diner,Seattle,1,1,1,5,"I have never had a worse experience than I did on Sunday, March 15th. Five of us arrived at the restaurant after having reservations. One of us was concerned about Covid so we got a table outside. It was raining and upper 30s but since there were outdoor patio heaters, we figured no problem. 

After waiting 10 minutes after being seated and asking to have the heater lit, i went inside to ask if they could light the heaters. I immediately received attitude from Jeremiah, the restaurant manager. I was definitely not rude but I did insist that they light it because it only takes a couple of seconds to do so. He came outside and lit the heater. After five minutes, the heater went out due to no propane. We inquired again to get the heater lit, and the hostess told us that they were out of propane. We weren’t happy but nothing we could do about it. A couple of minutes later Jeremiah came out and brought a new propane tank and we were pretty happy about that. 

As he was installing the tank, he made a comment to me about being super busy and that he didn’t need the attitude from us. I couldn’t believe what I just heard and I am mediately shot back stating that I have been waiting outside for 10 minutes with nobody helping us. He told me that we weren’t waiting for 10 minutes and continued to give me major attitude. I was getting pretty upset by this time and asked him if this is how he talked to his customers. He told me that not only does he have the right to do so but has permission from the restaurant owner. I was furious by this time and said something with an expletive and he said I’m not going serve you. He was being a total dick about the situation and it was something that definitely did not need to escalate the way it did. I will never ever go back to that restaurant and I’m hoping that I get some sort of response here on yelp with an apology and explanation. i’m also going to reach out to the restaurant owner, and let him know how Jeremiah treats customers!",open_table
