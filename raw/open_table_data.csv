0,5,5,5,5,"This was my first time at Regards. We took my mom with us and she is not super accustomed to eating like this and she ABSOLUTELY LOVED it. We all loved it. The hamachi collar was so good we couldnât get enough of it. We ordered one of each section on the menu and for three people we were totally satiated. The Birria was out of this world good. Service was outstanding and kind. We were close to the bar and it was early enough that we were able to chat about the cocktails and ingredients with the bar tender and our waitress and they were both so kind and patient.

Diver scallops were completely tasteless, shrimp tacos and hamachi cheek were better but middling. Our server asked about any food allergies when ordering (hazelnuts), then the kitchen brought out the tamales and said they contained hazelnuts (awkward, sent it back). We stopped after these three small plates, left still hungry, and went in search of something else on Congress St. This place feels like it has great potential; there are much better choices nearby.",Greater Boston,"Dined on April 6, 2024",REGARDS,open_table

We arrived early and were seated in an almost empty restaurant. We were served water then ignored for 5-7 minutes. When we ordered cocktails we asked for the bread and scallops first. Before the cocktails arrived we placed the rest of our order. First, the avocado tostada and shrimp tacos arrived, then the bread and scallops then the corn tamale. So we had five dishes on the table while we waited for wine to arrive. We gradually went through those dishes and, almost done, asked about the lamb which we assumed had been forgotten. The server assured us it was coming and it did several minutes later. So, the food is creative and delicious. We loved the scallops, shrimp, avocado and bread. The wine from Baha CA was intriguing. It will be a long time before we return just because of the service.",Greater Boston,"Dined on March 16, 2024",REGARDS,open_table

10,5,5,5,5,"Check out this great restaurant. 
Four of us ate dinner at Regards Saturday night & totally enjoyed our meals. We are adventurous eaters who love to try new foods. We cook gourmet meals for ourselves & friends & we want quality options. 

Our motto is that we don't mind spending a little more money, if the food is better than we would make for ourselves and or something we wouldn't generally take the time to prepare at home. 

Because, the food is influenced by Japanese & Mexican roots, we had to ""ask Siri"" to define many of the menu items, but that was fun too. 

I am gluten/dairy intolerant & often restaurants will only have a few options that I can choose from, but at Regards, I had endless options & didn't feel like I was missing out on the ""good choices"".

The first dish we chose, ceviche, was too acidic to appreciate the fish and tampered the ability to really taste the nuances of some of the other dishes.  We did love the tamale and hangar steak, they were the highlights! The smoked panna cotta was also wonderfully rich and creamy.  The apple ice cream could have used just a tad less caramel (cajeta?) which overpowered the ice cream flavor.

The scallops dish, with the thinly sliced scallops, daikon radish and marinated tapioca balls that burst in your mouth ohhhh I didnât want this dish to end. The cabbageâ¦.might seem a trivial item but you have never tasted cabbage this good! Seriously, Iâm dreaming about it. The cheese on top, the Caesar dressing, the tenderness of the cabbage and the aioli sorta dressing on the side with a hint of garlic and some heat; made this dish absolutely delectable. The hamachi collar with the charred outside and tender velvety meat wrapped in Bibb lettuce with the spicy sauce to scoop up - yum. Just yum, it was fantastic to perfection. I did not care for the pesky toe crab dish with the chewy rice; felt it lacked flavor although the husk cherry added to the needed boost and made my mouth appreciate it a tiny bit more. The corn dessert we got on a whim due to recommendation from our neighboring table, with the honeyed figs and corn ice cream was somewhat weird?? Not boring but different.

Our favorites were the ceviche (melon!), and the fish collars.  (Desperate to know the ingredients in the secret sauce!)  Least enthusiastic reception was probably for the scallop crudo.  No particular reason; it just didn't pop the way everything else did.  We all agreed that we were on the edge of our comfort zones the whole time, and we liked it; it was a wonderful ride.  Given that we got nine different dishes, our waiter had to make a lot of trips from the kitchen to our table and do a lot of explaining.  He was wonderful; the pacing was perfect.

The tortillas and miso butter - tortillas seemed liked they had been warmed and left sitting out resulting in chewy dried tortillas with flavorless butter served on the side.  The crab and rice dish looked hopeful, but started with some crab flavor and pieces, and ended with leftover rice and mayonnaise.  The shrimp tacos were underwhelming.  One piece of shrimp atop butter lettuce in a tortilla and drowned in a citrus vinaigrette and some sort of crema.  Overprices, for what you get, quality and flavor painfully lacking.  Our server was very nice, but checked on us way too often to be comfortable and by the end of the meal was MIA, we had to ask the bartender for our check and then after waiting another 15 minutes had to bring the check up to the manager to pay.

The dim lighting was somehow sad. The outside tables don't reflect the inside prices. No one chose to sit outside, thought the weather was perfect.

Steak was very good but overwhelmed by mole sauce; the hamachi fish collar was delectable but it was too much effort to get to the meat. The radish-heavy scallops and martini didn't come close to those aforementioned establishments and were disappointing. We did mention to our server that one dish (sea bass) was way over-salted and we barely touched it but there it was on the bill. Oh well.

188,5,5,5,5,"While the menu is limited as you will see on other reviews - this allows them to focus on what they do have on the menu. This is typically done in many High end European restaurants and in kitchens of Michelin star restaurants, so forgive the Americans complaining about the menu, as they do not know any better. They do something as simple as a Cesar salad with great care and effort that you can taste.
One of our friends we brought was laughing at how small the menu was on the way over and seemed very skeptical. By the end of their meal they said they would be back.
This doesnât mean that the restaurant couldnât do with a bit more variation, having weekly specials or more side options would have been nice.",Greater Boston,"Dined on October 28, 2023",Little Tap House,open_table

My husband got a drink without any adaptations, and we both agree that the drinks were completely unpalatable.

Service was fine, but the food was not good (almost awful). ï¿¼My wife and daughter didnât like their dinners (shrimp tacos with very little flavor and roasted Brussels sprouts smothered in some kind of cheese, a very unusual preparation).  But, it was my mushroom risotto that was the worst.  Rather than having the Parmesan stirred into the rice, it was simply a few shavings on top of what tasted like boiled rice.  I donât think it was even Arborio rice. It was super bland (complete opposite of what risotto should be) and had hardly any mushrooms in it.  Honestly, I feel I could have made something better from a box for $3 rather than spending $27 on this.  I really hate to be critical of a place weâve supported and enjoyed for a long time, but last nightâs meal was truly terrible.

We then waited 15 minutes for a server who never showed up. The hostess attempted to take our drink order, but those drinks never made it to our table.

The baked brie didn't taste anything like any brie we have ever had. The poutine had thin salty gravy and the fries were skinny shoestring with an off flavor. Kudos for using real cheese curd.

That was the best part of our whole dining experience. We ordered Mussels ( fair)  very little broth but how in a town that prides itself on its seafood can you go wrong? We decided to get the Sloppy Joe sliders and Gnocchi. When the food arrived ( we waited way to long), My husband took one bite of the sloppy joes ( should name them sloppy nots) and made a face. My husband has the worst palate and eats pretty much everything, so seeing his face I was surprised. I asked what was wrong and he said it tasted like the chef dumped an entire container of salt in the food. I tasted it was gritty and full of salt.  He said he could not eat it. My Gnocchi was awful as well. It had a thick brown glaze that tasted like a very umami flavor gone wrong. The waitress tried to fix it by replacing it with a squash risotto. That was a mistake. The tiny squash boat thing was filled with an uncooked wet risotto that had the worst honey, syrupy drizzle that made it taste like a candy corn that had melted on top of it. The owner came over and acted like we were annoying her and would not even adjust our dining. We left hungry a hundred dollars poorer and annoyed.

The food was fantastic and the prices were on-par with most Portland restaurants. We started with the beef carpaccio and I'm kicking myself for not taking a picture because it was equally beautiful as it was delicious. The beef was shaved thinly, topped with arugula, capers, crostini and some lemony white truffle dressing that was out of this world. I had to stop myself from licking the plate. I ordered the spicy margarita which had just a hint of spice and didn't taste much like a margarita, more so like a lemon-thyme vodka cocktail. It was still good but not what I was expecting. I also had the cucumber basil smash which was light and refreshing. For my entree I had the duck breast over butternut squash risotto and sautÃ©ed spinach. The sauce of ""sherried plums and dates"" was the perfect accompaniment. All the elements worked beautifully together. The perfect balance of savory, sweet and tangy.

636,3,2,4,3,"The cocktails were delicious and the garlic knots were wonderful. I ordered the margherita pizza, which was very salty and expensive ($17 for an individual pizza). We were happy with the wait staff. My biggest complaint is the 4% charge added to every bill to help cover the cost of David's utility bill. As disclosed on the menu, this 4% charge is to help defray the costs of David's electric bill so that they can pay their staff better. This is ridiculous. The restaurant is already expensive and the wait staff is tipped on the total cost of the bill. Is it appropriate to tip them 4% less, since they are allegedly getting the benefit of that 4% upcharge? While I understand that costs of ingredients have gone up in the recent past, these costs seemed to have stabilized and, presumably, David's has raised the cost of its menu items to account for inflation. Electricity is a part of doing business and is not the responsibility of David's customers.",Maine,"Dined on December 9, 2023",David's Restaurant,open_table

The downside for me was that we sat in front, which is by the windows and in front of the kitchen.  It tends to be noisier here but, also, you get the smells from the kitchen and leave with them on you!

We shared a Caesar Salad to start. It was really good, dressed to perfection and a great starter.

I had the Tournedos au Pouvre. The dish was amazing. The peppercorns in the sauce make it a little spicy but it's fantastic. The veggies and potatoes that come with it, compliment the meat well.

My husband chose David's Meatloaf. It was as delicious as it looks in the photos. We were both beyond pleased with our selections and would 100% try this restaurant again if we return to Portland, ME.

I cannot remember a meal with such mediocre food, poor service, slow food delivery, and high prices.    To be specific, we waited 25 minutes to place our food order.   We were literally looking all around to find our server to order.    The starters came within a reasonable amount of time.  However, we waited 90+ minutes, yes, 90 minutes, to receive our main course!  We sat down at 6:10.  We received our food at 8pm.   We had to call the server over and ask when we were going to eat.  She explained the kitchen was backed up.   Hereâs the next problem: the food was average at best.  The lobster ravioli was literally swimming in sauce.  It was a soup.  The steak Au poive was overcooked to medium well despite we ordered medium.   The haddock was swimming in a ton of blueberry sauce; it was no âqastriqueâ.    It was blueberry jam with fish.  Bizarre.  The potatoes on the salmon special were bland, colorless and not good.   The blueberry tart dessert had a lime curd that was supposed to be set in the tart and was complete liquid.   It was unreal and should not have been served.  And for this delightful dinner we paid $400 for a party of 5.     Overpriced.   Terrible service.   Slow food delivery and sub-par food.

Both were then unenjoyable at warm temperatures.  The tomato had a produce sticker on it. Had it been washed? There was no Olive oil on the salad or Maldon salt as listed in the menu. The Carpaccio did not have truffle oil as the menu stated and was covered with tons of croutons and a thick caesar-seasoned mayonnaise.  The wine listed on the menu was not the wine that they had in stock. The steak was done to the temperature we requested, although the sauce was like a cheap steak house.

Both men in our party felt their serving was a bit small (duck and the nightly haddock special) particularly for the price, but were satisfied. I rarely eat my entire entree, but was able to easily clear my haddock/crab dish. We did not order dessert.  We were seated near a large party of younger people and it was a bit loud while they were there. They left about 1/2 way through our meal and then our dining area was more conducive to conversation.

This time, Anna was our server and bartender. Excellent martinis! She did an excellent job, despite the restaurant being quite busy--she was clearly stretched while we were there. We started with the raw oysters again (how could we not?). Next, I went gaga over the New England clam chowder. The Sherry in it made all the difference. Best chowder I had on this trip. For entrees, we thoroughly enjoyed two delicious gourmet pizzas. First was the Caribbean jerk chicken pizza with caramelized onions, goat cheese, cilantro, sweet & spicy chili coconut milk, and arugula (tasty). The second was The Athena: tomatoes, fresh garlic, sweet Italian sausage, Kalamata olives, spinach, feta and house cheeses.

During lunch, the servers also double as bartenders, and Courtney shined with solid martinis for each of us. When in Maine...we started with raw oysters. (We've been downing raw bar for 40+ years, and the oysters we had in Maine were the best we've ever had.) Next, my wife and I shared the Ahi tuna crudo, which was amazing! Delicious and one of the best presentations we've seen. Beautiful. For our next course, we had salmon burgers with French fries (that day's special). The fries were perfect.

The service was slower than what I thought was usual but our server was polite and accommodating - I liked him.  I try to understand that good help is a premium now and am patient with slow service.

1227,5,5,5,5,"Had just arrived in Portland and waited a bit late to get a reservation, so we ended up sitting at the chefâs counter - despite it being a bit warm (but nothing we couldnât handle), we ended up loving it!  It was a pleasure to watch Sierra and her well-organized and capable team push out plate after beautiful plate.  The potstickers were a delicious combination of balanced flavor and heat; the watermelon, pea shoots and feta salad with the candied almond crumble was refreshing and flavorful (and frankly better than expected).  And the OMG cheese pizza was so good we had to use expletives!  The service was equally great - competent, and just the right amount of attentiveness.

We travel a lot, and rely heavily on local recommendations for good food (being careful who we ask!).  And when we do use Open Table, we are often disappointed by the very restaurants that receive tons of rave reviews and loads of stars.

Our waitress, Megan, was very knowledgeable about the menu items and gave us helpful suggestions. To start I ordered the tuna carpaccio. Although delicious, I expected paper thin slices of tuna, and received small thick rectanglesâ¦which was odd. I followed that with the pesto handkerchief pasta which was tasty, but not the standout that I recall from previous visits.
We ordered two focaccia for the table and both (the pizzata and the pizza) were delicious. The winner of the night was my husbandâs tortellini. Exceptional!
Our guests got the sundae and raved about it and we shared a cannelloni. Very orange forward.

1404,1,2,4,3,"I had heard so much about this restaurant however it turned out to be $577.00 worth of disappointment. We were a party of 6 however seated at a table that clearly could only seat 4 people. Two of us were seated on the ends of the table and there was a horizontal piece of wood preventing us from putting out feed under the table. My back was killing me. My husband equally unimpressed and he never complains about anything. The food was just okay. Nothing over the top and my shrimp was over cooked and for $38.00 one would hope for more than 1  1/2 shrimp. The portion size was not much so we filled up on bread mostly which by the way was excellent. We were celebrating an engagement and a birthday so I could not bring myself to fuss about the table or anything. I just kept thinking what's all the hype about this place? Scales Restaurant, David's, Street n Co and so many other places are a much better spend so I would suggest spending your money at somewhere else. I think the drinks were good but the alcohol pour were pretty light. As a pro they did send over a round of shots as an acknowledgement for the special occasions were were celebrating. That was very sweet and much appreciated. 

I did come home and read the reviews (after the fact) and anyone that gave this restaurant a low star was responded to by the owner who shot back with excuse after excuse and did not take responsibility for anything. I would imagine this will be the case with my review. This is an honest review so take it for what it is worth. I will never be back to this restaurant and we eat out often.

This was on the eve of our wedding anniversary, which they acknowledged on a beautiful dessert plate. Megan was our server. She did the best possible job. She was knowledgeable, personable, attentive, and energetic. We started with a mackerel crudo, which was very good, and the tuna tartare (delicious and with a very creative presentation), which we enjoyed with a glass of Prosecco. For entrees, we each loved the seared duck breast dinner. It was outstanding! The wine list is very good; we shared a bottle of Amarone with the entrees. For dessert, tiramisu (awesome) and a strawberry/rhubarb tart topped with vanilla ice cream (also a winner). This was a big-time wow experience! We'd definitely return on a future visit to Portland.

Food: 
Starters:
Insalata di Polpo, this octopus salad was tasty and an excellent choice. Focaccia di Recco. This slightly toasted bread with a type of burrata cheese and prosciutto came warm a also a ""good"" choice.
The main courses: Scallops, I thought was very good. It was a mixture of potatoes brava, thinly sliced sausage in a light saffron base with roasted vegetables and baby scallops. My wife had tortellini in a bolognese sauce. This was slightly dried out as if it had sat under the lights a bit too long.
Dessert:
Vedric recommended an assortment of ice creams that was somehow very different and very good, with Liquor saturated white raisins!

It left me feeling like âif youâre not going to die, donât worry about itâ. Like because of my allergy he would rather not have me as a customer.  It made it very difficult to trust the food.  We ordered a very basic pasta dish and took off as quickly as we could.  It was a special birthday dinner and it got ruined by poor service.  No one should have to describe medical details of their conditions in order to feel safe at a restaurant.  

Aside from this server, it seemed like a very nice place and I overheard other servers handling allergy questions professionally and responsibly.

They brought us inside to give us drinks and water and that was more than fine, and then gave us our sorbet desserts free later, since our dinner went until 11pm. But honestly they didnât need to because we had such a great meal. Our server was so buoyant and nice and made a great wine recommendation. Overall a really great experience. The burrata is a must try along with the pesto pasta and the green salad. The rib eye dish was a little random in construction in terms of what we expected, but still delicious. Very fancy meal out.

Both were absolutely delicious.  For appetizer we got the tomato, mozzarella and basil salad.  The tomatoes were super fresh and the salad was yummy.  The only criticism I have is that the salad was a bit small but the pastas were just perfect for our hungry stomachs. And for dessert we shared the tart with toasted meringue that was also very yummy.  The whole restaurant was filled with wall art that we found out was all painted by the ownerâs father in law.

The table we were seated at wasnât great. But was ok. The server seemed a little snooty. And was very condescending to one of us when we ordered wine. One of us ordered a Diet Coke. The other a Coke. She did not indicate that they did not have those products but brought cola type drinks thinking that would work. If we had known that was what was going to be served we would have declined. Nicely the server did not charge us for the one that was not drunk at all. Very nice to remove it from the bill. 

Overall the food was very good and we enjoyed the meal but at times it was soured by the server. Not sure if she was having a bad day or what was going on. But I hope she sees these comments.  We still tipped the usual 20%.",Columbus,"Dined on June 10, 2022",Solo Italiano,open_table

When I gave the host the name on the reservation he looked it up and said Iâll seat you at 7:30 and walked away without another word.  Not a warm welcome and really changed the tone of the evening.  Thankfully once we sat (at one of the tables that had been open all along), our waitress was very welcoming and made us feel good about being there.  The food was good, the drinks were good.  Dessert menu maybe lacked some depth.  Overall it was a pleasant evening.  But I donât know that I will return.

I originally had reservations for 6:45 and made a note that if they had any 6:00 cancellations we had tickets to a show at 8:00 PM and would like to have gotten in sooner. Due to a large party cancelling, they were able to get us in and called to let us know. We were delighted! Shawn recommended the Pappardelle Mushroom truffle dish. My husband had Chicken Parmagiano with a side of spaghetti. The red sauce was very flavorful and tasty! We enjoyed mocktails - a cosmopolitan for me and a virgin Mambo for my hubby. We enjoyed connoliâs for dessert. Though we could only eat one , they were delicious!! We took the second one home (along with lots of leftovers) to snack on at a later time!  The Corner room gets a 5 star review from us, and Shawn gets a perfect 10 for his pleasant disposition, warm smile, and ability to utilize friendly communication skills to quickly engage in establishing a positive connection with patrons.

The host and our waiter greeted us warmly.  Our waiter was well versed with the menu items.
We started with mussels which exceeded the quality that we often get at other places.  These mussels were nice and plump and filled out the shells.  The broth was delicious!  We also tried the Bruschetta which we loved and it was very filling (took some home) and we had the truffles Mac and Chz which also had leftovers to bring home.
Entrees were spaghetti and meat balls, wonderful and the meatballs were great!
Two of us had the squid ink pasta was delicious with some spice but the menu said it has mussels and shrimp but we didnât get shrimp in either plate.  I asked the waiter about this and he said that the menu only lists mussels.  When I got home I looked and saw that he was wrong.  That was a misstep on his part and disappointing for us as we would have enjoyed the shrimp especially considering we had already had mussels as an app.

2089,4,5,5,4,"Excited for a great experience.  We met some friends for dinner and they had eaten here before and enjoyed the experience.  Our server was attentive and the food was pretty good.  

The rating is due to several things; first, this nonsense of charging for bread is criminal, especially in an Italian restaurant.  It costs $1 yet you charge $8 and this was not even on the menu; the sourdough was but this was not what we got served. 

Also, the authentic Italian trattoria, we paid for a side of pasta yet the size of what we received was not $8 worth; the pasta plate, although they weren't run of the mill pasta was twice as much and probably was.  

I don't mind paying for good food or items made onsite but isn't this why I am dining out? There are somethings that have gotten out of hand and raking your customers over the coals is not cool.  While Portland, ME has come of age of late, just remember when the freight train is done, they will wonder why things become a wasteland.

There were a few negatives that lowered my rating: It was VERY loud which made it tiring to chat across the table. The lowest part of the meal was the time it took to get served. Between appetizers and main course, we waited over an hour. That meant that one of our party missed the ferry and had to take a later one. The other negative was the smoke from the kitchen which stung our eyes and left our clothes smelling strongly. 
The service was good in that our server was pleasant, and gave honest and helpful advice. The service was poor in that we had to wait so long -- sometimes that has nothing to do with the wait staff, though.

The place was super quaint and adorable with beautiful, ambience and decor not to mention the most beautiful fresh flowers Iâve ever seen in my whole life. Our waitress was amazing and very detailed and super bubbly and fun. We ordered espresso martinis, Caesar salad and for our entrÃ©es, I had the most amazing mac & cheese ever had in my whole life. My friend had the chicken Parmesan, which was equally incredible, and my other friend had a squid ink pasta dish. I tried every single item and the food was literally out of this world good. The last part was dessert and we got tiramisu, which was also equally incredible when it came time for the check, the waitress explained to us that they were comping our cocktails due to the wait for them being longer than they wouldâve liked. We were having such a lovely time, We didnât actually even notice the wait for the cocktails, but I told the waitress that I have never had that kind of service or incredibly kind gesture at a restaurant ever.

The real distraction was the ambient noise level. Since the restaurant is housed in a relatively narrow space but with very high ceilings to call the Corner Room loud was an understatement. You could not hear the other members of your party even though you were sitting in a booth together.

Service from our service was pretty lousy, a bit of a wisecracker - sort of an East German approach to customer service., grumbly, cut us off when we asked questions, almost broke the wine glasses as she seemed to almost slam them on the table. We should have none that this would set the tone for the night. The food was overall disappointing. Mussels which we shared as an app were excellent so the meal felt promising but quickly went downhill from there. My chicken parm was oversized, and generally unremarkable. I kept thinking âis this better than something I might pick up pre made at Hannafords?â Probably not. Itâs like they were trying compensate for it being mediocre by serving a double portion. My wife pizza was as she described it - basically inedible - chewy, and doughy and served almost like a salad with prosciutto and greens piled on so high you had to dig thorough it to cut it. Again it was like they were trying to hard to present something that looked appealing versus focusing on the food itself. Our third diner had a mushroom something or another. This was literally just a half bowl meal. There was zero depth to this, it was like being handed a bowl of porridge. I hadnât been there for about 7 years so thought weâd give it a try again, I guess I had forgotten why we hadnât been for so long. The only good news is that for three people, a shared app and a bottle of wine it was just over a hundred dollars.

The bruschetta and mixed drinks were excellent. I highly recommend trying the lemon drop. Great service! Our server was very attentive and made fantastic wine recommendations. I was super disappointed to learn that steak wasnât on the menu; even though I had scoped out the menu prior to making a reservation. The pork was mediocre at best. Zero ambience.

With that out of the way, once seated service was very good. Our order was taken by Susanne in a reasonable time, and when we informed her we had tickets for a nearby show, she waved her arm around and said ""So does everyone else.""- not in a bad way but in a fun way.

My wife had a glass of Chambord Bellini while I stayed with water; she ordered the 4 cheese mac and cheese while I had the chicken parmigiano with a side of spaghetti. We both enjoyed our meals, and the bread that came with the meal was very good as well.

Prices may be a bit on the high side (the chicken parm would come just with the chicken and sauce, and the size of the side of pasta was small compared to the price. Price before tax was $58, with $10 for the glass of wine.

If you are going to be seeing a show at the Merrill Auditorium, this is a good (but slightly pricey) option to try.

So we got a drink at the bar after the busy bartender got to us. I asked for merlot and was given a glass, but later at the table when I asked for a second, our server informed me that they didnât serve merlot. So who knows what I got... While waiting in the bar area we were verbally assaulted by a rather drunk man that did not stop talking to us the whole time we were waiting. When we got to our table, our server seemed displeased that we were already beveraged. Other than that she was efficient and helpful. The carpaccio and caprese salad were delicious. My mother and son enjoyed their chicken parm; although, I was shocked that at that price they were still charging for a side of pasta. Half the building is currently under construction, so the atmosphere was a bit jarring. Overall, our server was good to us and accommodated my sonâs wishes for vanilla gelato for dessert.

I had the chicken parmigiana, crispy edges and juicy chicken.  The sauce was authentic with tiny pieces of carrot, what I use for sweetener in sauce.  The very best part was the the baked crespelle.  Braised beef in an tender crepe with sauce and cheese.   Mmmmmm!  Thatâs my one word review.  I loved the decor!

2689,1,1,3,3,"First off, we are not the complaining type when it comes to restaurants.  Our philosophy is that if we get a bad meal, chalk it up to experience and donât go back.  But when itâs really bad, sometimes you have to say something, especially with the price point that the Rooms are at.  I ordered the pan seared flank steak special, medium rare, and specified âon the rare sideâ.  My wife ordered the chicken parmigiana.  When my meal came out, the meat was well done, not an ounce of pink.  But I was starving, so I just ate it and didnât bother complaining.  My wifeâs order, though?  Absolutely terrible.  Iâve had the chicken parmigiana here before and raved that it was the best in town.  What happened?  It looked unappetizing from the start, like it was over cooked and they tried to save it.  The chicken was dry, the coating was a soggy mess, and the cheese was burnt.  Oh, and the linguine side that came with it looked like something youâd get at a hospital cafeteria.  The bread, salad, and drinks were good, but if thatâs the only good part of a meal, you might as well go to Olive Garden and save yourself some money.  I will say, that when we did complain, they were very apologetic, offering us free deserts, and comping us the meal.  Unfortunately, despite their efforts and the fact that weâve had great meals there in the past, I canât say that weâll be back anytime soon.",Greater Boston,"Dined on November 24, 2018",The Corner Room,open_table

Although the trend is for cooking with no salt, the pasta itself was bland. Pasta water needs some salt. ((Just ask my nona!). You can add salt from shaker to your pasta dish  but it just tastes like salt on top of pasta. It doesnât cook through. The mozzarella in the Caprase salad was not fresh buffalo mozzarella. It was thick and dry, not light and airy.   I would have chosen another cut of pasta than handkerchief pasta for the sausage white beans dish â which was delicious. Difficult to eat the large pieces of pasta even after cutting it several times. Pizza excellent; garlic bread to die for. Wonderful Caesar salad.

Asparagus was perfectly steamed with expertly cut thin sliced prosciutto.  EVOO served requires you to dredge the house baked bread. Yum!  Bar seating is fun with plenty of space. Cold water vodka blueberry martini provides some local flair and is delicious.  I also enjoy that the same man that has been preparing the salads, and apps for years is still there!

Apps were good, our party liked the mussels and the calamari, despite a very fiery hot chili sauce. Dinner presented well, the trout dish was well plated. My wife enjoyed her salmon as well. My steak, although requested medium was cold to the touch rare and needed to be returned. It was scraped off the plate and brought back to the grill. For a $50 plate, that felt sloppy. Overall it was good but not the level of finesse one would expect. The least appealing part of the night was the chef yelling at staff. He was clearly upset and it was quite evident in tone.

The steak was a little well done for my wifeâs liking but tasted pretty fresh. 
The scallops with lobster risotto were tasty but a little high priced for only 4.  The biggest downside was sitting at a tiny table in the middle of the restaurant.

2833,5,5,5,5,"My wife and I recently had the most delightful evening at The Grill Room in Portland, Maine, and I simply cannot stop raving about our experience. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and a cozy ambiance that instantly set the tone for a perfect night out.

The Grill Room offers a menu that exudes creativity and passion. Every dish we tried was a true work of art, beautifully presented and bursting with flavors that left our taste buds dancing with joy. From the perfectly seared scallops to the mouthwatering ribeye steak, each bite was a culinary masterpiece that showcased the chef's expertise and dedication to excellence.

Not only was the food impeccable, but the service was equally remarkable. The waitstaff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about the dishes they were serving. They seamlessly guided us through the menu, offering recommendations and ensuring that we had everything we needed to enhance our dining experience.

What truly stood out to us was the attention to detail and the use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The Grill Room takes great pride in supporting local farmers and fishermen, and it reflects in the quality of their dishes. Every ingredient was meticulously chosen, resulting in flavors that were vibrant, honest, and absolutely delicious.

The atmosphere at The Grill Room was also worth mentioning. The restaurant has a sophisticated yet relaxed vibe that made us feel right at home. The dim lighting, rustic decor, and soft music created a romantic and intimate setting, perfect for a special evening with loved ones.

As the night drew to a close, we couldn't help but feel grateful for the experience we had at The Grill Room. It was a wonderful reminder of how food can be an art form, and how a great dining experience can truly create lasting memories.

The escargot had no flavor to it whatsoever. Our steaks arrived. We ordered ribeyes, medium rare. We were asked to cut them to make sure that they were done to our liking. They were very very rare in the middle, and we sent the bat to be grilled again. When they came back with the ribeyes, they were black from being burned. It really ruined the flavor of the ribeye, but they were done medium rare. Itâs been a year since weâve been to this place and we went back to see how it is.

3092,2,1,3,3,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.  We went there for our anniversary (our only night in Portland) and the food was extremely disappointing. The filet was very undercooked (ordered medium rare), to the point where is was simply not edible.  The mashed potatoes were dry and the flavor was bland. The Caesar salad starter was the only good thing about the meal, however, we were told there were not anchovies on it, but it had a couple large anchovies. The Management removed the entre from our bill, but at that point, it was too late and our anniversary dinner was ruined.  We had been the year prior and the meal was better but the French onion soup had a funky taste. Also, they typically have a gourmet burger, but it appears they have changed the bun (which previously was a nice dark house made bun), and the overall appearance did not look as good, so we did not order that which was also disappointing.

When I made the reservation, I specifically said in the comments section that it was our 11th Wedding Anniversary. The Grill Room clearly had no idea that was the case, and I wasn't about to announce it at the restaurant, given my annoyance and disappointment.

This failure is on The Grill Room. Whoever is in charge of being the restaurant's mediator between the customer and Open Table failed to be thorough.

Oh well, we're not narcissistic enough to have let it spoil our evening.

The service was friendly and adequate, but our server put in the minimum amount of time (clearly in a hurry) necessary to cover his other tables, probably to minimum requirement also.

Our water glasses (the only beverage we utilize) were empty 70% of the meal's duration. That is excusable at Longhorn Steakhouse- (and not even really then), but it is legitimately inexcusable in an upscale establishment such as The Grill Room.  

The food was excellent.

My husband got the wedge salad which was also overly large.  Our server told us after the fact that salads were shareable, but frankly the âgreensâ could have easily fed 4 people.

Be sure to look at their descriptions of the cool before ordering because it may not be what youâre used to outside of this restaurant.  It took 45 min to get our salads, so when my steak arrived undercooked I did not send it back as we had been there almost 90 minutes from ordering  before receding our meals.  My husband ordered the filet which he said was good, but my steak was unseasoned and medium rare at best.

I said husband 50th birthday. His fav place. We brought out 17 yr. Old son and 15 yr. Old daughter and like them to experience fine dining. They have been to higher end restaurants many times. Our server, Erika S had no personality and it was painful to tell us the specials which she could barely verbalize. Kiddos to the hostess to say happy birthday.
We noticed the amazing waiter serving the table next to us and said happy birthday and offered the couple a complimentary dessert. My daughter whispered to me and said that will happen to dad. Our server was inattentive and on her phone the whole time. Had to ask the bus boy for a side plate. I was so jealous as the waiter next to us was so welcoming and friendly to his customers. My son said this waitress does not want to be here. I am tired of â understandingâ the waitstaff. We are. Going out to pay $200+ for a celebration with my children. She waiting at the Thirsty Pig or Applebees. I was a waitress when I was younger and understand the job. She should NOT be working at a high end restaurant. We enjoy fine dining and willing to pay for it and show our children the proper way to dine as they get older. She didnât offer us dessert or anything nice as a Happy Birthday . She was not busy. Restaurant was 1/2 full. Quietest I have seen it in last 6 months. I gave get a Groupon that Iâce forgotten to use for sometime. She forgot to take it off. And annoyed when I courteously asked her . Eye was annoyed. She then came back and tossed the leather card holder down and walked away. I then signed it and still tipped on the original bill and gave the horrible service 17% which was way too much for what we revived. I then look at the cardholder and are forgot ti give me back my credit card.

- We were seated and ordered drinks then waited 20 minutes for those drinks 
- We asked for bottle water then waited another 15 to get it after asking another server for help. 
- We ordered bang bang shrimp for an app and it was soggy and undercooked
- For entree we ordered a ribeye and filet medium along with Caesar salad, carrots, spicy broccoli, 2 burgers and some sauces. This is where things get really badâ¦.
- Our steaks come out one at a time in a random order with sides put sporadically all over the table without taking any of the side plates out of the way. I mean I was literally dipping my elbow in the sides!!
- The wait staff seemed to not worry nor have a clue or care about anything except for one table at a time. 
- The steaks were all undercooked and very rare which was not ordered. 
- The house burgers were undercooked but the bacon was so overcooked that the char taste overpowered the actual meal. 
- We brought this up to the waiter very politely and not wanting anything for free, yet the waiter told us that we shouldâve cut into the steak before eating therefore pushing blame onto us. (Which a customer shouldnât have to check the steak before eating if itâs a good steakhouse)

Salmon was overly charred, I have had it before so I know what it is supposed to be. Waiter told me to peel back the salmon char.

I made a note in our Open Table reservation that he is severely celiac and mentioned this to our waitress multiple times. We ordered the mussles with no bread (simple enough) and since we were sitting directly next to the kitchen and expo station, we watched as multiple servers and Harding himself take the bread off the dish and try to reserve it to us without us knowing. We sent it back and watched the same thing happen multiple times and even heard ""just serve it he""ll be fine"". After watching this happen 3 times, we just sent the last round back and waited for our entrees. There was no apology and no acknowledgement of the issue by the staff. We sat for an hour and 45 minutes before any food was on the table that we could actually eat. The steaks were good, thankfully, but we will not be returning. For a $200+ meal, I expect higher quality attention to guests needs and requests.

So, he dropped us the bill for our drinks and appetizer- and no sort of consideration for the horrible service at all.  A $70 evening with no actual food.

A heavy work schedule left me with last minute choices for dinner at a reasonable time in Portland on a Friday evening and the earliest reservation I could obtain was 8:30 pm.   We decided to arrive a bit early and have a cocktail at the bar before dinner.  Just prior to ordering, my husband spotted two empty seats at the chefâs counter.  Jackpot!  They were available and just happened to be the best seats in the house for these two foodies.  

No disappointment here.  Eric, our waiter was incredible.  Personable, knowledgeable and attentive, but not overly so.  

The other stars of the evening were the chef, sous chefs and Will.  We followed a doe eyed, hard working, eager to learn young aspiring cook feverishly making every attempt to please.  We soon learned tonight was Willâs first night.  Chef and team took the time during a very hectic dinner rush to teach and Will appeared to listen and learn, all while working to please.

The food is fantastic and everyone works very hard.  We live locally and will look forward to making this a regular Friday evening stop.  We will surely wait  patiently for two coveted seats at the chefâs counter.

There was never an apology given, or any acknowledgment of us having to wait.  A good restaurant wouldâve compensated us somehow for our time.

Then our drinks showed up 40 minutes after we ordered them and after we were half way through our appetizers.  The serverâs breath was unbearable and could literally smell it from 6â away.  Then the main course arrived overcooked and seriously burnt.  Luckily, we didnât have any knives to cut into it for about 5 minutes so the steaks were able to get cold.

To begin, it is tough to get in but was seated within minutes of arriving for my reservation. The restaurant seemed busy, but not overly so. Took 25 minutes for server to bring drinks and menu. 

Ordered a rib eye medium, so my wife could enjoy as I usually get medium rare. It was less than rare, but it took so long, that I didnât send it back. She asked for a wedge which had the most runny dressing Iâve ever seen. The bottle of wine was a good choice from Argentina. We passed on dessert as the quality of the food wasnât there. 

Now we are fairly understanding that with Covid, staffing is a challenge. I didnât get the feeling it was staffing, just service that wasnât up to snuff.

Not restaurant related, but over the years Portland ME has become more and more of a dump. Itâs terrible what is happening to most cities in America.

Which is why you come to Maine but needed a break from lobster. Can you imagine?) and was on the fancier side. The Grill Room & Bar fit the bill perfectly. It is relatively small which gives it an exclusive feel and the menu is simple which makes ordering very easy. The ambience was perfect if you want a romantic evening or want to feel like you are on an adult date (we have 3 kids so that is a rare opportunity). The prices are steep, but they match the quality of food. Everything was cooked to perfection and the mixed drinks did not hold anything back. Dessert is not on the menu, but is also available.

Order the bone-in ribeye medium rare, and you will get a steak beautifully charred on the outside, red in the middle--exactly as described in their doneness definitions on the menu. This steak is perfect as is, flavorful and satisfying. It needs no sauces, and it is salted perfectly.
Sides and drinks are good enough, if not up to the grilled meat. My martini was a little on the weak and not adequately chilled. Wine list complements the food and is very reasonably priced.
My only objection is the noise, which makes conversation strained. There is always going to be enough noise if there is a bar; the background music is objectionable and needless.",Baltimore,"Dined on July 1, 2021",The Grill Room &amp; Bar,open_table

Spending $150 on a dinner with a shared appetizer and 1 glass of wine, then being rushed out after an hour, makes this dinner not worth it.

I ordered The Grill room salad or an appetizer and when it came it looked OK until I dug into the lettuce underneath, it was not fresh it was brown. My fish was Bert around the outside and cold in the middle and contained many pin bones!

The steak, although cooked medium when we requested medium well, was still very good - I just prefer my steak to be warm throughout and not still red.

3686,5,5,5,4,We had a wonderful trip to Portland ME and this was our first dinner. We ended up sitting up at the bar and had a GREAT view of the chef owner and kitchen. The bartender / waiter was engaging and knowledgeable. The food was amazing and I loved the eclectic nature of its origins. The grilled Octopus w/ chimichurri sauce was incredible and the eggplant lasagna was both delicious and lighter than expected. The cocktail combinations were creative and tasty. Not being a dessert person the biggest surprise came from dessert. I never order dessert because I am a savory over sweet person but the bartender highly recommended the Dulche de Leche cake and it did not disappoint!! The only draw back is that it is a bit off the main part of town and resides near a homeless shelter so many homeless were around the streets around the restaurant.,Greater Boston,"Dined on October 6, 2023",Isa Bistro - Portland,open_table

The neighborhood; walking there was a bit uncomfortable but there were plenty of people out and about and no one paid us any mind.  And I felt more comfortable walking back after a good experience walking there.  I would recommend driving if you don't want to cross some busy roads and don't like walking up hill.

4012,4,5,5,4,"Isa is one of those little bistros where one might possibly expect that the restaurant would be sparsely populated and quiet, and if you grab a table or bar seat by 6 PM, that would be accurate. However, by 6:30, it becomes obvious that Isa seems to have  a cult following, as the bistro almost imperceptibly fills, and because of the banter between the barkeep or waiter with incoming clientele, it is evident that the majority of lucky diners are regulars - yes, even on Monday ( reservations highly recommended ). 

There are no wrong decisions to be made when perusing the single page menu. Each is uniquely original, and delicious. However, if off-menu specials are offered, I would strongly recommend you consider waiving your 1st choice and returning at a later date. You wonât be disappointed. And, anytime burrata is offered, order it - a rule of thumb I happily adopted in Rome. Bottom line: Visit, and Enjoy!",Greater Boston,"Dined on January 2, 2023",Isa Bistro - Portland,open_table

The service was impeccable, including how our server chased us down the street after the meal to give us the windbreaker my husband had left behind!

Food was average - my steak didnât really taste all that special, though the potatoes were awesome, and my partnerâs pork was really good. The pacing and general attitude from staff was off the entire night - when we needed our waitress, she wasnât there, when we didnât, she was, but unhappily. I have a lot of empathy for poor service because I worked for many years in the trade myself and know how it is when staff is overwhelmed, but for the price, this type of average food and poor service just wasnât worth it.",Pittsburgh,"Dined on August 25, 2022",Isa Bistro - Portland,open_table

The grilled octopus was also tender with a crispy exterior, and the grilled shrimp with pickled onion and chimichurri were fantastic. One note: if you plan to share, do ask about how many pieces there are per plate, because it varies. The wine selection is terrific and less per glass than most places in the same category.

Drinks were inconsistent, one drink served in a small glass jar, ordered a second of the same drink that came out in a glass twice the size, same price for both?

Pros: 
-The atmosphere is great. Dim lighting, eclectic decor, cozy vibe, and it's always busy making it a great place for any occasion, ambiance-wise. 
-Great cocktails, beer and wine selection.
-Servers are pleasant

Cons:
-I wasn't impressed with the menu. We ended up ordering four things to share of which two were good and two were not - The sour dough bread was undercooked and the beef skewers were overdone and not great. The shishito peppers were delicious and the market salad was great.
-Our waiter was very nice and pretty attentive, however it was very obvious that the food runners had no clue what they were doing. Our salad came out before our drinks, which I think I can confidently say is the first time I've ever been served food before a drink. The woman who brought out our shishito peppers asked us if we ordered green beans to which we replied no and watched her walk around asking all the tables around us if it was theirs with a dumbfounded look on her face... Finally I flagged her over and asked if it was shishito peppers. Our beef skewers came out after we asked for the check. The entire night I watched as multiple tables around us were brought the wrong dishes...

They did replace and recook the dish, but did not offer apologies and charged full price.   For our main course we split the wasabi coated scallops - that were overcooked, did not have any wasabi on them and portion-wise was smaller than the appetizers - four defrosted very small rubbery salty scallops.

We wanted a little bit of everything, so we ordered the mussels, hummus and flatbread, deviled eggs, and gnocchi. The food was delicious and the portions were perfect to share. We resisted the urge to drink the white wine garlic sauce from the mussels and instead soaked it up with the homemade bread and butter. (Youâd want to drink it too, itâs that good!) We were too full to have dessert at the restaurant, but decided to take home a flourless chocolate torte and cheesecake with homemade raspberry compote, donât judge, we came to eat!

4517,1,1,1,5,"I have never had a worse experience than I did on Sunday, March 15th. Five of us arrived at the restaurant after having reservations. One of us was concerned about Covid so we got a table outside. It was raining and upper 30s but since there were outdoor patio heaters, we figured no problem. 

After waiting 10 minutes after being seated and asking to have the heater lit, i went inside to ask if they could light the heaters. I immediately received attitude from Jeremiah, the restaurant manager. I was definitely not rude but I did insist that they light it because it only takes a couple of seconds to do so. He came outside and lit the heater. After five minutes, the heater went out due to no propane. We inquired again to get the heater lit, and the hostess told us that they were out of propane. We werenât happy but nothing we could do about it. A couple of minutes later Jeremiah came out and brought a new propane tank and we were pretty happy about that. 

As he was installing the tank, he made a comment to me about being super busy and that he didnât need the attitude from us. I couldnât believe what I just heard and I am mediately shot back stating that I have been waiting outside for 10 minutes with nobody helping us. He told me that we werenât waiting for 10 minutes and continued to give me major attitude. I was getting pretty upset by this time and asked him if this is how he talked to his customers. He told me that not only does he have the right to do so but has permission from the restaurant owner. I was furious by this time and said something with an expletive and he said Iâm not going serve you. He was being a total dick about the situation and it was something that definitely did not need to escalate the way it did. I will never ever go back to that restaurant and Iâm hoping that I get some sort of response here on yelp with an apology and explanation. iâm also going to reach out to the restaurant owner, and let him know how Jeremiah treats customers!",Seattle,"Dined on March 14, 2021",Local 188,open_table

The bowl for shells was like a cereal bowl, so small the shells were spilling out over the table. The server, who was clearly not happy to have a table at 8 pm
as-they were slowing down as she told us, passed by
many times and never replaced the bowl. We sat  with dishes and shells on table for  far too long before they were cleared  as entries arrived . Several times we had to ask for things that should have been

The food was mostly like the decor, a little worn out with flashes of style.  The scallops which were a âspecialâ were indeed special but the paella and gnocchi as standards on the menu were good but ordinary. 
In a city whoâs food game is already on a high heat setting, the owners of Local 188 should consider upping their game plan.

Some standouts are deviled eggs, the mussels (tried it with red this time, very good!), the goat cheese au gratin, and the mushroom risotto.

Those were the most perfectly cooked mussels I have ever eaten. The staff was accommodating.

They have a nice assortment of cocktails. I had one with whiskey and ginger (don't remember the name) and my wife had the Great North Woods - delicious! We shared the hummus and flatbread to start. This came out in an unexpected way - one giant piece of flatbread with the hummus on top. It definitely worked for the two of us but I was trying to imagine a group sharing this. (It would have been a little difficult, and maybe a tad unhygienic.) The flavor was great though. I had the mushroom risotto for my dinner and it was very good, well-seasoned and the rice was cooked perfectly. My wife ordered the sirloin and while the grits and leeks were delicious, the meat was a little overcooked (more of a medium-well than a medium). I wonder if it had died a bit while the risotto was going. She thought the flavor was good though. Two things that really stood out were my surprise about the portions (very generous!) and I love the great beer variety, many of which are local (they will even let you buy samplers if you don't want a full glass of something).

My wife and I shared 4 tapas between us, and it was plenty of food. It's fun because you sample different flavors that way. The grilled chicken on skewers was great, with an interesting piquant sauce. The mussels in the white sauce was a classic moules Marinieres with white wine and garlic. Mussels were plump and juicy and served piping hot. Patatas Bravas were hot, crispy roasted potatoes with aioli. The meatballs had a rich red sauce and cheese. Had a couple glasses of robust tasting Rioja to wash it all down.

The chicken pinchu (I could be butchering the name--skewered chicken with a crispy, spicy crust and yogurt dip) was also good, though a bit undercooked (which required a return to the oven for a few moments--no biggie!).

They continue to innovate, maintaining their standards while enlarging their repertoire with a niche not found elsewhere in Portland (a contemporary Spanish influenced menu), at least not done this well. I have been there often, never disappointed. Their staff takes great care and gives the experience a personal touch that is not found in some of the other name or trendy high end restaurants in town. The menu is imaginative and well paired with a thoughtful wine and cocktail list. Locally sourced (and unique) ingredients are used when available.  The flavor combinations that are found here are easily within the top tier of any restaurant in town and I am continually surprised that it is often overlooked for James Beard or other similar awards.  Perhaps that is just as well, as I can still have the expectation of getting a table or a seat at the counter.  The owners also deserve credit for assembling the talent and values all restaurants should have, but few attain on a consistent basis. Too many rely on their reputation or simply don't make the effort, or worse cannot sustain the consistency resulting in disappointing expectations.  Local 188 is an extremely underrated restaurant and, despite the town's food reputation, its easily my number 1 out of a small handful I can rely on both in terms of quality and experience. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone from anywhere, whether for a casual brunch or special occasion.  Its not very formal, but I think that works to its advantage.

I find that it takes every ounce of willpower to avoid picking up the handles of the pan and pouring the food into my mouth.  :)  If it wasn't for the pan being extremely hot or choking on the mussel shells, I might just try to do it.  I also enjoyed the grilled asparagus salad and my Mother loved her chicken livers.  No one really liked the hanger steak.  We all had it cooked differently, but what was believed to be a very tender part of the cow just seemed too chewy.  The portion was small and already sliced; with most of the plate being reserved for a 1990s-2000s style presentation of sauce seemingly done with a paintbrush.  The hoisin sauce, which we were all looking forward to, was tucked so close to one piece of the steak that it was almost missed by everyone.  The deviled eggs were enjoyed by all and are another dish that never disappoints; regardless of who is with me when I go.  The prices are such that one can imagine helping to pay the rent more so than for the cost of the food.  One expects there to be a balance between price and amount of food presented.  It seems that Local 188 is harking back to the days when large price tags and tiny little plates of food were all the rage.  I suppose it only became glaringly obvious when I decided to bring my Parents there for Easter and they insisted on paying.  Truly embarrassing.

Remember this is about three bites into our entree. She was clearly very anxious to leave with her friends who were seated at a table nearby. She then proceeded to return to our table multiple times to check for payment.  I asked for the manager who upon hearing our story said ""is that it?"" Hmmm.... Not sure what to say to that! I guess customer service is not what they are going for. Our second time around with this same waitress wasn't much better, after waiting 20 minutes for drinks she managed to spill wine on my coat, I get accidents happen but when you combine it with forgetting to come back to take our orders for another 15-20 minutes, forgetting our second round of drinks completely, capped off with offering us a complementary dessert to fix things she then forgot to bring my husband the glass of port he ordered to accompany my dessert!

For our appetizer we had the deviled eggs which tasted mainly like fried onions yet I can't recall there being mention of onions on the menu and were a bit runny. For my main entree and something not found often in America I tried the pallella, that tasted more like brown rice soup and nothing like I recall in Barcelona. I now know why this is rarely served in the US despite its simplicity. To top the whole thing off the meal was $100 and not close to worth half.

We started with 3 tapas, the patatas bravas, pickle plate, and deviled eggs...all awesome. We then shared the seafood paella, which took a long time to come out due to a misunderstanding between the waitress and chef, which the waitress apologized for. When it finally came out, it was delicious!! though a little salty. We got a comp. dessert as an apology. Overall, great dinner although we wish it was a little quieter and also not so smokey.

Main courses were paella with chourico, mussels, clams, and saffron rice. It was in a flavorful broth that didn't drown the ingredients but fused with the rice and proteins equally.

Firstly the overall feel is super comfortable, the staff was super friendly when you were speaking to them. Iâm not sure if it was just our waitress but she never asked how our food was, Iâm sure she could tell by our facial expressions we were unimpressed and the fact that 80% of my food remained on the plate and my fiancÃ©es plate still had a decent amount left as well. Letâs start with where it all went wrong. The Gorgonzola Compound Butter. I have never smelled or tasted something so atrocious in my entire life. It ruined the entire meal. I knew it was a butter so I assumed it would be fine. The whole time I kept saying it smelled like curdled milk. Now letâs talk fries, there was a sauce that went on them that was also very off. I canât remember the exact name but within just minutes the fries became soggy and the both of us couldnât enjoy them because the sauce was also not something we could get past. I got one piece of steak that was saved from the compound butter and a few fries and thatâs all I could stomach. When the waitress asked about desert we were extremely hesitant but we went for it. We got the chocolate cake type thing and it was certainty better than our dinner but not anything that I would say I would ever order again. Without the sauces the meal could have been a hit.

For our entrees, I had tagliatelle with shrimp in a salmon crÃ¨me sauce while my girlfriend had gemeli with butternut squash and sausage. The house made pasta was to die for, it was absolutely perfect and flavorful. The salmon crÃ¨me sauce was the perfect combination with the extra large shrimp.

The waitress was outstanding, but the disappointment began after we starting eating mussels which were too large and undercooked. The sauce was amazing though! When our entrees arrived, they looked marvelous. The presentation lovely. The Pork Saltimbocca was to die for, but the Carbonara not so much. The pasta, which they say is made daily was undercooked to the point where it was gooey and dry at the same time. And, the dish was way too salty. Our choice of wine was perfect though, a lovely Pino Nero, we hadn't had before. One other point, there was a party next to us having a good old time but the bartender came in and asked them to leave because they needed the table and he was a bit abrupt and it wasn't handled properly in front of others.

Other entrees were chicken Milanese that I tasted and would order.  Eggplant parm which looked good and another pasta dish maybe carbonara and he just about licked his plate.

5349,3,4,3,3,"We arrived on time 6:00pm and was seated at our table quickly. We were brought water immediately as we got comfortable at our table in the front room. Unfortunately our first conversation was the thought of whether our vehicle would be towed. We parked in the back parking lot because the streets were full, why would a nice restaurant like the Roma not provide parking for customers? As we scanned the menu all we could hear was a group of 4 , a few tables away ranting and coughing about as if they were the owners of the place. We tried our best to ignore them but the sound was to piercing. After 15 minutes my wife agreed to just order and make the best of it. She ordered squash ravioli and I ordered chicken parmigiana. We sipped our wine anticipating our mealâs arrival. Our wine was topped off as our dinner arrived at our table, and our waiter was very nice. My wife was a bit surprised at the small portion of ravioli she was brought, a large bowl with only the bottom containing the food. My wife is not a large person and for the cost, the portions should have been better. I ended up cutting a section of my food to share as we tried to make the best out of our night. 
When our bill came to the table I was surprised to see we owed $125 + tipâ¦ We have been out to many other places  and for what we received it was not worth the money. 
We both grew up in this city and wanted to try a place that has been around for years and had some value, Unfortunately we will not be coming back anytime soon .

We sat down and she asked if she could take our drink order (literally as we sat down). We asked for a moment and she just stood there. Had to ask her to come back.  She came back in about 60 seconds. Had to send her away again.  Iâm all for attentive service but this felt highly pressured. When she took our drink order she asked if we wanted to place our food order. Again, we asked for more time. This place was not busy and  by our estimation they werenât getting any busier since we had a 7pm reservation.  When she came back quickly again we said weâd order appetizers. She wouldnât take our order unless we ordered our dinner too. This is how the entire meal went. 
As for the food, the Caesar salad was really good. The rest of the meal not so much. All but one entree was cold. I Had the carbonara, it was cold and lacked any sort of flavor. It was a tiny portion as well.  Neither my wife or our guests enjoyed their entrees.  Again, cold and major lack of flavor. 
Desserts were marginal at best.  It was our first time there and I see little hope for improvement so we wonât be coming. Major improvements needed all around.

5429,3,2,4,4,"Recently visited Roma for dinner with a party of 5. We ordered 4 distinct meals. The cod was excellent, cooked with a wonderful char and served with couscous and fresh vegetables. The chicken parm was well executed. On the other hand, the carbonara was a mixed bag. Pasta was fresh, prepared al dente, but not very flavorful and arrived in a very small portion. Additionally, the carbonara was advertised to be topped with a duck egg, but what arrived was remarkably chicken-like. Finally, the squid ink tagliatelle with clams was most disappointing. The pasta was dry, with the only flavor coming from the lemon being used to mask the lack of freshness of the clams. It arrived with a parsley garnish, which was by far the other overwhelming flavor, and did not complement the delicate seafood flavors. The restaurant is in a beautiful building, the service was very nice, so it was disappointing that the food was so mediocre.

Our main course was okay, but just that.  The half chicken meal was swimming in some sort of red liquid which made the entire dish soggy and not at all tasty.  The chicken parm was unappealing.
The best part of the meal was the dessert, the almond cake.  It had a tasty crunch on the outside and a creamy almond taste inside.  The prices were extremely high (even in the post-pandemic days when most restaurant owners appear to want to make up for lost revenue in one month).  We do understand the hardship that this industry has faced and want to support them.  However, the low quality of the ingredients cannot be justified with such high prices.

5530,3,3,5,5,"The Roma post-COVID reopening is a very different place, in terms of both amenities and the menu. Last year we loved that its menu was filled with classic Italian, but done absolutely masterfully. The meals you have known since you were a kid, served at the peak of excellence. All in a gorgeously maintained Victorian that feels like dining in someone's impressive home. Our trip this time still had meals served with excellence in a nice setting, but the menu has fully changed. The classics are gone, replaced by an unexpected fusion that left me scratching my head, and missing many key elements (no chicken entrees, for example). That was combined with a severe paring back of amenities -- they said COVID prevented them from serving bread, yet they were eager to try to up-sell us some grilled ciabattas instead? How about just offering the grilled ciabatta? Which comes to the value. For the fewer amenities, the price actually went *up* instead of down. A glass of ordinary Chianti for $12. A bowl of, essentially, really nice pasta with really nice meat sauce for $26. With no side. A dessert that was 3 doughnut holes with a tasty lemon sauce for another $10. I like Roma, I even liked the experience this time. But I could never see myself spending $150 for 2 there again if that was what I was getting for my money.

Next, my pasta and meatballs entree was the deal killer - the pasta was overcooked and NOT al dente, the sauce had a very peculiar taste, did someone else make the sauce? Not at all the delicious and wonderful cuisine I have come to love and expect from Roma. On the bright side, my husband ordered the Casco Bay Flounder which was perfectly crisp and although maybe a tiny heavy on the sauce - it was the highlight of the dinner.

All pasta is homemade & just as important, cooked al dente perfectly.  I had the Rigatoni Bolognese, a rich thick dish with a divine bolognese sauce.  My husband had Eggplant Parm and according to him, the best eggplant parm EVER!  After begging, I was given a taste and have to agree with his assessment.  The eggplant was not soggy, a big problem in my book.

The salad was badly underdressed and we couldnât taste any vinegar in the vinaigrette at all. For entrees we chose the mussels fra diavalo with the seafood add on (which was only 5 shrimp, âseafoodâimplies that there would be more than just shrimp) and the veal parm.

Our martinis were made well. Our server seemed grudging and in a hurry in spite of the half full dining room. We ordered garlic bread and marinated olives with our drinks. The garlic bread was soggy, the olives never appeared. When asked about the olives, the server simply said they didn't have any. My main course was eggplant parmesan with pasta and vegetable of the day. On the plate, it was a central pile of overcooked spaghetti marinara, barely warm, over which was a large slice of breaded and fried eggplant covered with marinara sauce and mozzarella, fired in a grill before serving. The cheese was burned on the edges, making it very difficult to cut through with a knife and fork. On the edge of the plate were scattered a few fiddleheads that had been well cooked in garlic and oil, the best part of my dinner. My wife's main, mussels fra diavolo, was better, earning ""average at best"" from her. They were out of the two wines I wanted to try.

The piece of chicken was  excessive it spanned the entire plate and although I can appreciate big portions if the flavor and breading style and texture of the chicken doesnât back it up you end up leaving disappointed. I wish they put as much thought into that dish as their nightly special. I understand chicken Parm Itâs probably a staple there and has been on the menu forever but it was soggy and the sauce was nothing to brag about. I make chicken parm at home and there was no crisp or crunch It just mushed when you bit into it.

5671,3,3,4,4,"While the mozzarella appetizer was excellent, the other parts of the meal were a little lack luster.  Keep in mind, I am a fussy Italian - My nana came from Italy and I was there with my dad, also fussy.  The Bolognese had pasta that was a little too cooked...definitely not near al dente.  My step daughter, 11, still loved it but allowed us all to taste it so that worked out.  My husband ordered the chicken parm with linguine and they gave him spaghetti.  I had the chicken milanese and unless I'm wrong, there is supposed to be some lemon in the sauce and I didn't notice any lemon flavor, whatsoever, as the menu described.  I did end up using the small lemon slice they gave but was a little disappointed. My father ordered the veal piccata.  While it was pounded thinly, it had a little more fat than he was used to.  If you want bread, you'll have to buy the garlic bread (was excellent) but they do not offer you bread with your meal like other places.   The Tiramisu was good and my dad and my husband enjoyed the amaretto cheesecake with the strawberry sauce.   Service was good - our waitress was very nice.    The red sauce I liked and it seemed abruzzi style, which I like.

We both enjoyed the bread that came with a wonderful olive oil sprinkled with parmesan cheese--a nice touch.  If you go from 5 to 6 p.m., Sunday through Thursday, you can get a good glass of wine for $5.  The prices at Roma are fair.   Roma is our favorite Italian restaurant in Portland.

Mussels fra diavolo was nice, perfectly spiced, lots of mussels. Pasta with chicken, sausage, and peppers was disappointing. Only one piece of sausage, strong vinegar flavor, and soggy pasta. This was a restaurant week entree. Surprised that the special menu had smaller portions than if ordered off the regular menu. Adding up prices, it means the only deal is a free cannoli.

There were four of us, we all ordered from the restaurant week menu; in addition we ordered garlic bread (that never came).  To start we ordered a bottle of wine, a bottled beer  and a Tanguray martini with olives.  The martini came about 2/3rd full with no olives.  Apparently they were out.  In my opinion, the server should have told us before presenting the drink.  The beer came without a glass.  The wine arrived fine.   We reminded the server about the garlic bread order.  Three of us had Caesar salad.  It was very good.   The fourth had the mushroom toast, which was also very good.  WE again requested the garlic bread.  For dinner we ordered two fra diavolos.  Serving size was a little small.  One chicken dish, very good and the pork dish, good but not great.  We didn't get the garlic bread so told the server to cancel.  She said that another table had trouble with their garlic bread order as well??? We ordered three coffees to go with the cannolis dessert.  The restaurant was out of half and half.  The cannolis were very good.  We got the bill.  The garlic bread was still included.  We had it removed.

The Victorian setting, good choice of background music and cozy homey atmosphere are an excellent environment for a fine restaurant. We found the food flavors to be strained with strong flavors and heavy sauce. The pasta was obviously reheated or well overcooked...to the point of starchy and mushy. The kitchen was not busy, so no excuse. Acknowledging that this is Southern Italian cooking, the competition in Portland is well beyond average. So, this average food will not stand out as culinary destination. The wine list was fully adequate. 

A more refined/ formal staff is suggested. Table clothes, exuberant welcoming by hostess, larger portions, basic comfort food (not overpowered by strong sauces or overcooked cheese) will go a long way.

The food was good and the wine very nice but the spaghetti and meatballs dish was outlandish--way too much in the bowl with two HUGE (looked like half a pound each) meatballs and a mound of spaghetti, enough for a family of four in one dish and very off-putting.  Only other complaint is that, since they are primarily an Italian restaurant, they could offer even more choices of pasta, such as spaghettini or even angel hair, and also the addition of lasagna.

However, inconsistencies bother me at restaurants, particularly from a place that hasn't altered their menu since they opened. To me, that means they are happy with their menu and have mastered these dishes. So when things are inconsistent after three perfect dinners there, it's somewhat irritating. They swapped out fettuccine pasta for the tagliatelle bolognese (...ok). It came out so piping hot, we could not touch it for 10 minutes! No sight of their famous Grana Padano cheese wheel, only a small sliver remains on display and might explain why they (1) never offered us their regular complimentary giardiniera with chunks of cheese, (2) used the cheese in our pasta dishes (it was lacking this flavor), or (3) offered to grate fresh cheese over our plates. What a shame because this imported cheese to me is what makes this place special, and otherwise simple pasta dishes taste unique and unable to replicate at home. They also forgot the requested anchovies on the Caesar salad; and the chicken liver toast was almost burnt and very skimpy on the liver mousse. Staff was professional & friendly (hasn't always been the case on the latter), but the kitchen clearly ""phoned it in"" that night.

I ordered the schnitzel (which I love) however: it was smothered in a creamed cabbage sauce that made it all soggy - ruined it for me.

Vegetables are popular right now and something green or perhaps some mashed potatoes would improve the dish.  A big solitary hunk of rib meat does not stand well alone.  My partner had the Spaghetti Squash ""pasta"" with mushrooms.  The dish was soaked in an overabundance of rich cream which made it way too heavy, a little goes along ways.

6217,2,2,3,3,We really wanted to like our meal here but it seemed everything was against this. The front door was kept open all evening making it quite cold. Like many places these days they were seriously understaffed and the ones there were very stressed. The noise level was so loud we couldnât hold a conversation. The worst part was the food- I ordered the pork and it was drowning in a cloying sweet sauce. I was struggling to cut it until someone came around to check and offered a steak knife. It was a large serving but there was so much sauce I was afraid it would get everywhere as I attempted to cut it up. My husband had the duck and it was under seasoned and nothing special.

6228,2,1,5,3,"The food was hit or miss. Mostly miss. It seems like many things were mis-described on the menu. 
 I started with a blueberry seltzer- it turned out to be a blueberry cider - the can didnât say âseltzerâ anywhere but the menu did. The online menu, which we viewed to make our reservations still listed the duck meatballs with whipped ricotta but the menu didnât have them because the chef moved on and took the recipe with him. 
Our group ordered the poutine, the mussels, and the peppers with aioli for an appetizer.  The peppers were good, the mussels were great and the poutine wasâ¦not poutine. It was polenta fries. Which was fine because the menu said polenta fries but they were more like bricks. We then tried to order crispy chicken sandwiches and front room salads. They were out of chicken so we settled for carnitas tacos and steak. The pork carnitas were made of pork belly which was extremely fatty and the fat was not rendered properly, plus the pork belly was slightly cold. The tortillas were so strongly flavorful that they overpowered the rest of the dish. We each took a bite of our taco and didnât finish. The salads were interesting but the dressing was under seasoned. The steak was cooked properly as ordered but not seasoned at all. Wanted to like the place because the ambiance was interesting and the server was great but the food was so disappointing we wonât be back.",New York City,"Dined on August 20, 2022",The Front Room,open_table

Noise level inside was turned up to 11. It's always loud but this was LOUD. We moved outside, which was good. The breeze was nice and even the noise of buses and Harleys was better than the inside. 
Food? well, it was fine except for the foreign object in the mashed potatoes...a hard, thick, mystery disk about the size of a quarter. I discovered it when I took a big mouthful. Disgusting. It was not organic, I know that.
I pointed it out to our waitress who said she would talk to the manager about it. 
Then...nothing...not a word.

The steak was ok, not well flavored but cooked as requested, the sides were delicious. Dinner #2 was a combo of 2 apps, the Parmesan risotto and the chicken lettuce wraps, what a let down. The risotto was a gluey salt clump, and I like my food salted, this was inedible, the lettuce wraps were greasy and the âpickledâ carrots were limp matchsticks. Our third dinner companion had the French onion soup that was delivered to the table literally boiling and took close to 20 minutes before she could eat it, it was worth the wait, good flavor and savory. The goat cheese and beet salad was ok, not much flavor and the bland sherry vinaigrette did not dress it up.

I started out with beef carpaccio, for dinner had a crispy duck breast yum I ate everything each time. The beef carpaccio melted in my mouth and whatâs so cool about it was it came with what looked like bread croutons at first I got nervous because I canât eat bread. I called the waitress over and she confirmed it was fried polenta cake which tasted like a crouton it was so nice to eat bread substance and was so yummy with the beef carpaccio.
My waitress was absolutely amazing very attentive, we chatted excellent service. The only minor thing was I wish they had a more gf dessert menu they had one item on there but it would be cool to have two or more choices for dessert.

The restaurant adds a 4% surcharge to all bills to compensate for increased costs.

I guess my only critiques are that the dining room which is next to the open kitchen was quite hazy with kitchen smoke/vapors (would be great if they had better ventilation) and the prices seemed a little high for the proportions.

The large party of 6 was very loud...plus there was no acoustic treatment to any of the hard surfaces in the room (walls, bare floor, high ceiling) so voices and dishes noise just bounced around the room and made conversation difficult for us until the loud party left. 
The waitress talked to us like children and put her hands on her hips when she came to the table which was strange...

We were very uncomfortable because the woman at the table next to us was coughing and clearing her throat throughout our meal. A mask mandate should be enforced unless a person is actively eating or drinking. Otherwise a mask should cover the patronâs nose and mouth. I really also hope a proof of vaccination or negative test is passed by the city council. I also the woman who coughed did not have covid and is more responsible before she dines out again.

My vegetarian daughter and friend ordered the Moroccan medley and were underwhelmed.  They felt it was over spiced and not all that tasty.  I chose the Seafood Papardelle which was a stretch for me.  I enjoy shrimp and scallops but rarely order lobster and not familiar with sherry cream sauce which I found a little too sweet, probably my fault.
BUT we ordered one Cheesecake without rum caramel sauce or at least we thought!  It came including the Rum sauce and we were all thankful!  It was delicious and as it turns out one wasn't enough!
Bottom line is that it begin and ended really well but the middle was a little disappointing.  My daughter commented that the menu seemed to be a little abbreviated from previous visits.

The signature blueberry cocktail was equally as creative--the berries and fresh thyme were a nice touch; however, its overall effect was a bit too mild and diluted, served as it was in a waterglass with a generous amount of ice, as if it were a thirst-quencher rather than ""spirits.""

Plates for hibachi were dirty. Soup was COLD. Food was plated and I waited for my boyfriend to get his food while the other 5 of us ate. His food never came. We asked our server and he said itâs coming. He went back to the kitchen and came out 4-5 times with nothing.

7425,3,5,1,5,"I went to Kon with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday and we were all vastly disappointed with the service. When I made the reservation, I was told that if my party (of 6) and I did not arrive by our 7 PM reservation time, they could not guarantee we would get the Hibachi table we requested. That is understandable, as I worked in food service and know that there are other people waiting and that essentially for Hibachi, they cannot just hold a table if the party is late. We showed up right at 7 PM and were seated within 10 minutes of waiting, which was fine as we were all excited to celebrate.

The largest issue came with the fact that while we were seated at 7:10, we did not have anyone come over the start the Hibachi grill until 8:15 PM. That is completely unacceptable that we would have to wait an hour for the 'show' to begin, after being told we needed to arrive promptly at our reservation time. We got our drinks around 7:30ish, and then just sat there, waiting for the Hibachi waiter to come to our table. We even tried to flag a couple waitresses down and ask if we had been forgotten about, and they said they would look into sending someone over. Furthermore, my friends requested that I get a birthday celebration, as they normally do here -- there were about 3 other birthdays in the entire restaurant, and they all got the Kon-themed celebration except for me. I'm not sure why, and we waited for it, but it never happened.

We used to go frequently over the last 7-8 years but had a bad experience in early 2022 for my wifeâs birthday, and havenât been back until last night hoping things had improved.  Last night we ordered drinks and then an appetizer, Brussel sprouts, and then our server asked if we wanted to put our entrees in.  We said no not yet and his response was âwell if I donât put it in now, it will be a while but up to youâ.  So I ordered the beef Wellington and my wife ordered salmon.  As the server walked away, I asked if I could choose how the steak was cooked and was told âitâs all mediumâ.  The appetizer was good but my wife had to flag down our server after a bit for another glass of wine. Our food came out and my wife immediately noticed the salmon was under cooked but said sheâd just work around it.  My first couple bites of the Wellington were good, but then I cut a piece off for my wife and notice it was pretty rare.  When I looked at my piece, it was raw.  I would prefer to order steak rare and even this was well
Below that.  It again took a bit to get our servers attention and when I pointed I out the raw steak, he kind of stood and just stared waiting for us to say what we would like.  I asked if they could throw it back on for a few minutes and that I didnât even want a new one.  He came back after a minute and put the same steak back in front of me and said âso he wonât do itâ referring to the chef.  I promptly replied âthen I am not paying for that.â  He nodded and said âIâll see what I can doâ and left us for another several minutes.  Another man appeared and started clearing our plates  My wife told him to leave it, as we were waiting for a manager.  He introduced himself as a manager, but did not say his name.  He removed our food and nervously apologized and were not 100% sure he was a manage, as our server looked more professional than he did.

The creton, on our sandwich was excellent. But the sandwich--really every dish in the place, was too big. And brunch isn't really a dish that you can take home if you can't eat it all. Eggs don't travel or hold well. Delicious food, but too much of it. It's wasteful, or it's a contributor to America's obesity problem.
We asked for bacon ""really, really, crisp."" We made a point of this. The bacon arrived translucent.  When we made the reservation, we requested a table on the roof deck. We couldn't sit there because a wedding the night before didn't clear out until 2am, and they didn't have the staff to clean it up for brunch service.  Sitting inside is not for hard of hearing. Or even the okay of hearing. It was sooooo loud. We were a table of four, and only those sitting next to each other could hear the conversation. Over all, the food was good, but not good enough to go back. (Maybe I would do some doughnuts to go.)",Greater Boston,"Dined on August 27, 2023",The Frog and Turtle,open_table

7525,3,4,5,2,"We had never been here before and had dinner on a night we knew there would be a band playing outside the restaurant, so we expected louder than usual ambiance. However, there were 4 empty tables for 2 people in the main room/bar (the nicer part) but we were seated in a small side room with 2 large tables full of talkative adults having a great time all together. The sound from the band and the other diners  swirled around this small room making hearing my husband and the waiter impossible. It was actually quieter in the nice main room even tho it was closer to the band. The small side room was so poorly lit, we had to use cellphone flash lights to read the menu. (Cleaning the dead bugs out of the light fixtures and upping the bulb wattage would help a little). We looked at the menu online before arriving and were looking forward to their steak and seafood entrees. We discovered upon arrival they pared down the menu to just soup, salad, sandwiches and flatbreadsânot what we had hoped for. The menu was pared down to make it easier to get food out to customers on such a busy night. I appreciate that but wish I knew that in advance to avoid disappointment or to chose to dine here a different night. The food and service were excellent. But if itâs your first time here, be aware of the differences between rooms downstairs and ask if the full menu will be available on your night.",Greater Boston,"Dined on August 24, 2023",The Frog and Turtle,open_table

We stood near the bar for a solid 10 minutes before seeing a break at the bar to ask about our reservation. We were greeted rudely by the bartender telling us that the two seats we were standing next to were reserved, before I even asked anything. I stated that's why I was speaking to her, we had a reservation and could find no one else to speak to. We were directed over to the corner of the room where there was a young woman with her back to the rest of the room, leaned over a stand. I spoke to this girl asked her about our reservation and was told that there was another party there that wasn't quite finished yet and could we wait a little while longer. Okay fine. 25 minutes later we were still not seated, meanwhile servers and other restaurant staff were buzzing around, completely ignoring us. The other person in my party was finally able to catch someone's attention to ask for one of the four already cleared tables that appeared ready to be seated. With a huff, she seated us. Another 20 minutes goes by and I had to reach out to touch the arm of a passing server to get his attention so we could at least put a drink order in. Another 20 mins later, my friends drink arrives and was not even close to drinkable. Pure alcohol. Great entertainment (why we went). Food was ok, nothing special. I feel like our experience might have been better had they not been so overbooked. It seemed as though staff were not prepared for a large private party AND the crowd that the entertainment drew. Probably won't go again unless the entertainment draws us, definitely won't order food unless it's a quiet night.

We were seated next to the bar at a wobbly bar style tall table which was quite off putting. It was busy and no other tables were available otherwise I would have kindly asked to move.

After trying to put it on other peoples tables first the waitress then came and asked me if it was mine and I clearly didnât order that dish. She apologized and asked me if I wanted it. I was calm and just asked her for what I originally ordered. My guest ate while my order was being remade. Finally my food arrived and I was able to eat but my guest was waiting for me to receive my food and hers was ice cold by then. Her side of bacon was dangerously undercooked on one half and burnt on the other end. My Benedict was not what I aspected from this restaurant.

The service? Fantastic. Our server was extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, and provided us with excellent service and menu recommendations.

The atmosphere? It was live music Friday and it was LOUD. Extremely loud. Loud to the point that we couldnât hear our server, couldn't carry on a conversation, and for some portions of the evening I needed to pop in ear plugs because the volume was actually hurting my ears. The bandâs musicianship was good but the acoustics of the dining room were far  too bright for a drum kit and electric guitars amplified to that volume.  It was such a relief when the band packed it in for the night and we could actually chat with each other during dessert.

I wondered about this when servers at tables surrounding us mentioned all three specials and later brought it to our servers attention. He apologized and said he missed a meeting so only knew of one special. Nice kid, but thatâs not a good excuse. Then there was a cheesecake on the menu which we would have ordered for dessert around 5:30, but even though said cheesecake was served to a table beside us we were told it would be at least another hour before it was fully set. So that was a disappointment as well because we were told it was not available at that point. Seems like there could have been better planning since they open at 4:30 for dinner.

The past few times we have been however the music was abusively loud. In the summer they could accommodate us on the deck and we enjoyed our meal. Last night the hostess just said âThis is the best I can do.â  We were 6â from the bandâs amplifier and my wife was blinded by the stage lights. We left without ordering a thing and were really disappointed to have driven a half hour to find a restaurant that just isnât about the food anymore.

Their menu used to brag about everything being made to order and encouraged you to settle in. Their bar program and menu are creative. The kitchen is legit talented. We used to love F&T and now we just canât eat there. Guess weâre cranky old 40-somethingâs but weâre also a $200 two-top on a typical date night. 

What does F&T want to be? The atmosphere is standing room only, live band rocking the place, and screaming at the people you came with.

Decided to give F & T another try. Took over ten minutes for our sever to greet us and take our drink and appetizer order. 20 minutes later no drinks yet but appetizer comes out with a table runner. We politely ask about our beverages and are told that they will be right out. Meanwhile seeing that folks seated after us have already received beverages. 25 minutes later (thatâs 45 minutes after being seated) and we still havenât seen drinks or the server again. Eventually we spot the server and flag her down. Again we are told they will be right out. At this point itâs just not even worth wasting the time and money.

We asked the server how long for food and she said 25 minutes. At 7:56pm we order our appetizers(cup of chowder, pork belly, and fried calamari) and meals at once(2 ribeyes, 2 chicken, 1 salad, 1 bowl of chowder).

With all of that being said, we were there for 2 hours. And didnât even receive our meals in that time.

Weâre used to waiting for food at F&Tâ¦.itâs made from scratch & usually well worth the wait!  We waited longer than normal for our app (20 wings) and longer than normal for our meals. 2 of our 4 meals came incorrect (with mushrooms after requesting no mushrooms - we HATE mushrooms) & with stone cold onion rings.  When telling the server abt the 2 incorrect burgers, she said âif youâre not allergic to mushrooms I would eat them as itâll be another 30-45 minutes to replace themâ. So we unhappily picked our meals apart (mushrooms were encapsulated into the melted cheese) & ate what we could. When we finished, our waitress brought us the check & didnât even ask us if we wanted dessert, another cocktail, etc.  My wife went downstairs to speak to a manager abt our experience. Our concerns were brought to James (owner/chef) who refused to do anything abt it. She was told âour policy is if someone takes a bite of their meal, we wonât do anything abt it.â  We ate the wrong meals at the serverâs suggestion after having an entire evening of ridiculous wait times & wrong drinks/food showing upâ¦.and they refused to offer us anything. $200+ for a horrible experience!!!!",Greater Boston,"Dined on June 29, 2022",The Frog and Turtle,open_table

So I know that they have live music and I have been around this kind of thing all of my life and I'm not an older person so I can hang with the best of them, but there is a difference between concert levels and restaurants with live music levels, the PA system needed to be at least 30% lower to allow for most of the patrons whom were not there for the music to actually be able to have a conversation without screaming. On top of that we were told that the ""kitchen works best if you put all of your food in at once"" which didn't work for us since we were waiting for our third to get there and we just wanted to order a cheese board while we waited. It took 40 mins to get the cheese board and then another 40 mins to get our food, chicken wings and salads. So it was a bit of a mess.

However, we ended up waiting almost 30 minutes for our food, 15 minutes when we asked for a refill on drinks, and 30 minutes for our check. I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for the check.

However, it may be time for them to think about the layout of the restaurant and what is serving what purpose.

Additionally, the service was VERY slow, we were there for nearly 3 hours. We get that orders are hand-made and a wait is expected, but it seemed excessive. Our waitress was fun and lively and she did her best. I worry about how many tips these folks can get if the tables are not even turning over.

I ordered and appetizer and we both ordered our meals. There were 2 of us. 

We then proceeded to patiently wait as we know their food takes time. It took about 30 minutes before we were able to flag our waitress again to get another round of drinks. About an hour and a half after being seated.. she finally realized something was up. Offered us a free round of drinks. Took another 30 minutes to get our meals (we never got the appetizer). They sent my husband out something completely different than he ordered. They ended up comping all our drinks and his meal. 

I don't blame the waitress, she was clearly busy as it looked to be only 3 or 4 servers on. They made up for it with comping most of our time there. However I was so hungry I filled up on bread and didn't get to enjoy my delicious steak as much as I wanted. I also so desperately wanted the mussels as my appetizer.

There should be some prep. You shouldn't say on your menu that the meal may take about 30 mins and then nearly double that time... unacceptable. And that was my wife's meal... mine was Fish and Chips... Fish was flavorless as was the breading. The in house tarter sauce was disgusting too. No lemons offered nor salt on the table.

7876,1,1,1,1,"I honestly donât even know how to describe our experience. It was unusual from the start. We had plans following our reservation so allowed ourselves two hours to order and eat. Typically very doable.  Our waitress seemed pleasant but lacked experience. I understand that everyone is extremely short staffed and we are more then understanding of that. We ordered drinks and food and didnât see our waitress until she brought over one meal, a salad. We expected the other two meals shortly after(typically that is the way it works) over an hour went by and my mom had finished eating her salad and two of us, still no meal. We finally get our waitress over to the table after having to bother another staff member. She was unapologetic and advised it was a from âscratchâ kitchen and takes a while. We were waiting on a flatbread and burger. I get it good food takes time. However, she never checked on us and advised the food was taking longer, etc. nothing! We advised her we didnât have much longer to wait as we had plans to get to( it was an event with a start time) We didnât see her again until she asked when we had to leave. I advised her at this point about 5 minutes. Where she then says the meal wonât be ready. My boyfriend said he would wait and we went on our way. He gets the food to go which turned out to be the the wrong order (not realizing until he got home later). She was unapologetic and made no effort. The waitress comped a single beer. I wasnât expecting a free meal but we essentially paid $100 for food that we couldnât even eat at the restaurant we sat at for two hours.

There was a delay in waitstaff attending to us because we were advised the restaurant was short staffed. That said, our waitress was cordial and very helpful with menu items. The appetizer and salad were delicious. We also enjoyed a dessert which was just as tasty and the presentation on all were beautiful. The only issue was the ambiance. we were sitting outside on street and there was a band playing. Several intoxicated people attempted many times to sit at the open table next to us. Our waitress had to ask several people more than once to vacate the table as it was for their patrons. The persons were extremely rude despite her professionalism. It took away from our dining experience. A simple fix might be to post a sign during these music events so that people are aware where they can sit. Also, I would recommend that management check in with their patrons and or assist the waitresses with managing the drunkards. Itâs definitely a lot for a waitress to handle rude public who arenât even patrons while trying to attend to their paying customers especially with the staffing challenges.

I had their âlumberjackâ feature which was an odd marriage of bacon cheeseburger meets eggs Benedict. The good-they know how to poach an egg and the home fries had that satisfying crunch. Not so greatâ¦the burger part of this was pretty well undercooked. Iâm not afraid of rare but this was more than rare. The server, excellent by the way, recognized right away that it was undercooked and brought it back. I had to wait whilst my dining pal enjoyed their entree. The plate returned, clearly redone which I appreciate. However the baked beans (told you it was an odd marriage of things) although rich in flavor were cold and undercooked. Hollandaise was super thin, and nondescript. The Bloody Maryâs probably saved the experience along with the Elvis donut. Next time I think Iâll focus on that and skip the Benedict!

Food is delicious with good mix of flavors that does not go overboard.  Cocktails are seasonal and tasty.  Only criticism was on the service.  They may have been overwhelmed with the amount of folks coming in and returning from a long absence after Covid. Attention to the small things like silverware, extra napkins to clean up the food that may drip through the porous table, and delivery of drinks prior to meal would give this a full five star review. Since we were in no big rush, we were okay with waiting.

Food and drinks were delicious, but when we were trying to box up some food to go we were rushed by the waiter to clear the plates, resulting in not all the food we had purchased being able to be packed up to go.

Honestly, I ordered the special because included risotto...seriously, who doesnât love risotto. When the meal arrived, it was accompanied by rigatoni. All four at the table had recalled the special as including risotto. When the discrepancy was reported to the server, she insisted she had said ârigatoni.â I knew otherwise and her disingenuousness added to my disappointment.

They were also served with very thin toast points of some sort that normally are served with a cheese board.  You'd really think they would sever with a garlic toast or something that could soak the juice up better.

Both had an unacceptable amount of gristle that was inedible.

VERY fresh local fish in a very light batter that I thought was almost tempura-like.  Just plain delicious.  Our server was fun and attentive.  Unfortunately, the noise level was so high that it was very difficult to talk without screaming.  It really hurt the atmosphere badly.  The menu was casualand very much pub food.

The waiter was extremely attentive. As soon as we were seated, they didnât even ask, they just brought water. I forgot to ask for no pickles and he was available for me to change my order. The food came out quick and it was exceptional. The moment I finished my drink he brought me a new one. There was another server that brought out our food and we asked for more ketchup and she brought it right away, not in the next 5 min, within the same min and the place was pretty busy. I could tell the atmosphere at this company is team oriented. On my way to my car I noticed they had a nice TV in the kitchen. This looks like a great place to work.

The only con for me would be the noise level was quite high. It wasnât to the level where I would have liked to get up and leave but being a soft spoken person I had to speak up to talk with my wife. That being said I didnât have to speak up for anything else because the wait staff anticipated my every want and need!

Also, the food was really affordable for how good it was. For fish and chips at your average restaurant itâs like $23 bucks but it was $19 here at the time of this review. I wish more restaurants took a page out of this places book.

Weâve tried multiple menu items- both the Korean wings and Buffalo wings are to die for, the peach tartine is amazing as was the burrata. However, i would move to Maine for their steak and cheese and their pizza!!! The steak and cheese has homemade cheese sauce and the fries - omg- so crispy hand cut and delicious. Not greasy, not soggy, perfect crunch! Additionally the pizza is amazing, the dough is homemade in house and it was so crispy and soft at the same timeâ¦we had the Bianca pizza was great! Their desserts are all made by one of their servers, Kelsey, and let me tell ya, she will not let you down! The chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake was out of this world, Iâm only sad we didnât get to try another cheesecake flavor! The tiramisu chocolate cake was super moist and so flavorful.

My 8 year old asked for the wifi password and the server was kind enough  to type it in for him. Speaking of portions, my cheesesteak was overstuffed and made me wish I had eaten less of my appetizer. We had the poutine and the burratta and loved them both.

We ordered mixed drinks to start, and then we both had burgers, she with the fries as a side, me with mixed greens. Well I didn't intend to, but I ate the entire burger, it was that good. As did my friend. I tried her fries, they were delicious. Not previously frozen, near as I could tell. Our first time here, and we will definitely be back.

They, alone, are worth repeat visits.  Against the trend of offbeat and idiosyncratic for the sake the sake of being offbeat and idiosyncratic, the interesting and carefully selected ingredients are in service of the drinks, and not vice versa.  But, it's not just about the drinks.  The menu is small, but what's there is fantastic.  One of my first tests of any restaurant is the bread, and Magnus passed this test with flying colors.  We had small plates (one featuring a perfect presentation of carrots and the other and wonderful bluefin tuna crudo with fennel and fennel oil) and shared a larger plate (swordfish that was incredibly fresh and delicious paired with tomatoes that were cooked to the point of gentle caramelization -- wow).  The desert was a light and delicious almond cake with Maine blueberries.  Note that wine selection is limited, but well-curated, and they don't serve hot coffee in the summer (which might be a deal breaker for some).

We also loved the summer squash and reordered the same dish again.   The rabbit and swordfish on the main course were both perfectly prepared.  The cheese course and olive oil cake were perfect endings to a very memorable meal.  The wine list features low intervention selections from around the world and pairs well with the cuisine.

The food was really good but you do get the sense, as is the case, that the place was designed with the bar program, which is terrific, in mind first. The food is very good. They should lose the peppers; they are in exceptional and uninteresting and take away from any kind of wine pretty dramatically. Otherwise the food was quite good.  The menu was very limited and it was a drag that rabbit was one of two entrees, blech. We had the swordfish, which was great. Also had the cabbage and the tuna. The tuna tasted unusually fishy to me but I didnât mention it and my companion ate it up and enjoyed it. Service was terrific. I probably wouldnât drive down from Portland again given all the options here but I would go if I was in the area and recommend it to others.

Amy our server was amazing! She was also the bartender (which is a dual challenge).  Amy was pleasant, knowledgeable and attentive but clearly had bar responsibilities.

Our clam chowder was cold, chips & clam dip was mostly chips that were the consistency of saw dust.
My husbandâs steak had zero  seasoning, not a hint of basic salt & pepper. It was over cooked to a temperature of well done but he ordered it medium.  My lobster roll was made with fresh caught lobster but had absolutely no lemon aioli as per the description and the French fries were warm.   I donât mind paying Mkt price for a lobster roll but $40 for no aioli and warm French fries was ridiculous.

Two hits: cocktails were not very cold (Negronis ordered ice cold and straight up).  Bar was not busy as we were the first people there.  Although our server was solid, could tell that he was new and needed more thorough onboarding.  And every server should have a corkscrew on their person at all times and staff should be better informed re available wines.

One big recommendation.  For those who want to hike the Prout's Neck Loop before eating, they should be allowed to leave their driver's license and credit card at the desk, hike the loop and them eat.

9930,1,1,2,2,"Not a great experience. We were so hopeful as we walked in the hotel and were greeted by several different staff members, welcoming us! Walked to the restaurant, where they almost seemed confused about us even having a reservation (not that we even needed one considering over half of the restaurant was empty). We had made the reservation on Open Table, and my husband called earlier in the day and requested a window table since it was my birthday and he wanted it to be special. They did not accommodate the window request- they told us we would have to wait an hour for a window table....after we had made a reservation for a window table. We were sat at a table and a server came over before we could even look at the drink menu, so we asked for a minute while we decided what we want. It was then 15 minutes until they came back for our drink order. We took the opportunity of having the server there to order our meals too. Drinks took another 15 minutes to arrive despite the restaurant and bar being mostly empty. The mussels appetizer was good- credit where credit is due. My husband had the steak which was OK, but nothing special; served with asparagus and bland mashed potatoes. I ordered the seafood fra diavolo (the seafood special for the night)- the moment it was served I was hit with a wave of fish stink. Before my first bite I could tell it was bad. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it, and also had my husband try it...it honestly tasted like one of the seafood items in it had gone bad. It was inedible. As a ""courtesy"" they removed my entree and offered a free dessert. Now, nothing in life is guaranteed beyond death and taxes, but absolutely an inedible dish should be, and free dessert on your birthday is pretty commonplace. So, I guess thank you for offering a free dessert for serving me past-due seafood, but you should be doing that anyway on a guest's birthday.

9938,5,5,5,5,"Exemplary!  The Black Point Inn opened yesterday.  Myself and my friend were the first to arrive.  We are both VietNam veterans who chose Black Point to celebrate Military Appreciation Month.  We also chose the Inn for its history, its beautiful location and views of the sea, and its impeccably maintained grounds.

Everyone greeted us with warm smiles and welcoming thoughts.  

The Chart Room where we dined , seated by choice at a high top table as I am a 6 footer, was just large enough for 2 individuals to be comfortable.   We enjoyed the views of Scarborough Bay and the Mighty Atlantic.  It was a gorgeous day.

The cuisine was exactly as we expected, minus one easy tweak for the Chef.  The Chowder contained too much flour.  Our server took the suggestion to the Chef, and reported back that ""he would work on that correction"".  The Lobster Roll was the main event for both of us.  It was served on a toasted, buttery roll with an ample portion of steamed lobster much to our delight.  As a side we each had the side salad that came with a Lemon Vinaigrette Dressing.  Requesting the dressing on the side would be recommended as it is overpowering, but tasty.  

For dessert we had Warm Blueberry Pie with Vanilla ice cream.  Oh, my goodness, it was off-the-charts delicious.  

I would say this is a haven for adults out for a pleasurable getaway, or a romantic moment in time.  There were no young children on the premises when we were there.  

My friend and I both Retired USAF Flight Nurses came to the Inn not only to Celebrate Military Appreciation Month, but to also reflect on the moment Saigon Fell 30 April 1975 and to honor those Americans who never made it home.

Being from Scarborough and Saco and hadnât been there as a couple before so we decided to try it .
We used OpenTable, we were greeted ï¿¼professionally, set an a great table with a great view of the marsh, service was prompt. The âmaÃ®tre dââ/ host checked us in and checked on our service and food during our dining experienceï¿¼. Food was delicious, (except their Caesar salad doesnât have anchovies ð¢). The rolls (2) were listed at $3 with maple butter.  The butter had just a hint of maple, alleviating any guilt of mixing butter withï¿¼

My girlfriend prayed so I didnât pay much attention to the bill but they do have a $5 splitting ï¿¼plates charge.  I do not know if they charged us.
I ï¿¼ had the pork âpaillardâ marsala with good amount of two types ï¿¼mushrooms, mashed potatoes and steamed spinach .  Iâve been in the food business for 55 years and Iâve never seen the word âpaillardâ.

10169,3,3,3,4,"Mixed reviews on this visit. I have mostly had brunch prior which has generally been a great experience. 

On this visit, we decided to try an early dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty but it did not speed up the service or food. 

The waitress forgot simple things we requested, and I decided to try the seafood platter. It unfortunately was overcooked and the piece of fish (they claim was haddock - I don't think it was) did not impress as a fresh caught offering. 

They did please us with honoring a special dessert request - which helped a bit. 

Overall, my impression (having been a chef for 30 years) is that there could be improvements made. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great...now they just need to match that with more dynamic menu offerings and service that pays attention to detail and is more engaging.

I believe the restaurant is capable of upticking everything - making this place much more compelling, and taking it from a mediocre food experience to a highly desirable one. 

Would I recommend this restaurant? If there was a middle button to click between Yes and No....I would click that one for dinner, and Yes for brunch. So, though I am clicking Yes....it is with reservation so far for dinner. I will try once more to determine which way I vote.",Greater Boston,"Dined on July 1, 2019",Muddy Rudder Yarmouth,open_table

The popcorn shrimp appetizer was delicate in  breading and the tender shrimp perfectly cooked. The star through was the Monkfish stew. A good sized piece of fish surrounded by mussels in a wonderfully rich sauce based on crumbled sausage. This is a gluten free menu item, but this diner found garlic bread a perfect partner for every last dip of the sauce.",Greater Boston,"Dined on June 30, 2019",Muddy Rudder Yarmouth,open_table

Rather than sending it back and ruining the meal of the other two members of the party I chose to remain silent. My wife's meal, the same seafood platter was golden brown and cooked to perfection. Generally speaking, I've found the seafood platter to be  inconsistent but my love of seafood and the platter always ends up as my meal of choice. Next time I'm going to opt for the Osso Bucco. 

Minor issue which I'll attribute to a relatively busy night is that I was given the wrong check and had to wait while the credit was applied and the correct check was presented.

Waitress never came to the table to see how things were.  We were still hungry so ordered the blueberry pie.

Maybe add a more interesting side beside carrots and rice? Carrots were basic and rice was good.

Hostess was pleasant and we got seated pretty quickly although about 12 minutes later than our reservation (not required but we made one so we shouldn't have to wait.).  Lots of tables were open but I guess they were not assigned wait staff.

Waitress was a little slow in service and lacking in ongoing follow-up.  Had to keep asking for water refills, finally asked how food was about half way thru the meal.

Mussel appetizer was excellent but the large serving only can with two slices of bread.

Flank steak special was tough, more fat than normal and disappointing.  Lobster tail add on was presented very well but cool even though overcooked so it was tough and chewy. 

Seafood deep fry combo was excellent.

We politely asked to wait for a different table noticing there were quite a few empty tables and the host rudely informed us ""well....it will be awhile"". When we noticed the high tops available in the bar area, we asked to sit there and proceeded with our evening. The high top gave us a perfect view of what was happening.  It became all too clear that the focus and preferential seating was reserved for the regulars because the host obviously knew those he was seating. This restaurant needs to find a way to balance that given the fact that Freeport is a destination area. Give the host a lesson in courtesy if he is going to run the entrance.

It didn't look like pictures I have seen of sea bass dishes. It appeared to be thinly filleted, possibly taking away from the flavor. It almost appeared as if it was actually tilapia. To me, it definitely  wasn't  worth the price. My wife totally enjoyed the fried clams, stating they were the best she had ever had. Service was slow. The waitress was very good, but appeared to be overloaded with customers. It was long periods of time for our orders to be delivered to the table.

The pieces of the haddock were so small that they were over-breaded and over-cooked. I usually get pieces that size in what is known locally as ""chowder mix"". They also do not automatically serve cocktail sauce and lemon wedges. You just get a gob of non-descipt tartar sauce. They also failed on 2 occasions to serve sweet potato fries as ordered.

The food was great as well.  Three of us enjoyed soups (chowder & French Onion) as an appetizer and one had the calamari, all were delicious.  For Entrees, my Wife and a Friend had the steak tips, the other had the chicken pasta and I had the Fra Diavolo.   Everything was very well prepared and served.  Itâs been a long time since weâd visited the Muddy Rudder and it was well worth the trip back.  The next time, Iâm getting the tips!

Our server was friendly.  We ordered an appetizer and drinks.  We got our drinks quickly, but the appetizer took over 30 min.  The server informed us the kitchen was a bit backed up and apologized for the wait.  After the app, we waited another 35 min before our meals came out.  Three tables (a 4 top, a table of 3 and a couple) all arrived after us, ordered after us and all had their food before us.  I don't know how our order was ""backed up"", yet 9 other diners were able to eat in a reasonable turn around time.

When we finally received our dinners,  my husband and I were not impressed.  His rib eye was all gristle and over cooked.  My stuffed chicken was so over cooked and dry I  only managed to  get 2 bites of quasi-edible meat. My potatoes were stone cold, so despite paying extra money for the ""loaded"" version, I didn't get to eat them.  Because it was getting late and we waited too long already, we didn't dare send anything back.  We didn't say anything to our server & paid the bill and left a 20% tip.

My Caesar salad was well-prepared and tasty, but then things went a bit downhill.  The stuffed mushrooms were small, and were overwhelmed by a creamy, cheesy topping with tiny shrimp and other seafood bits in it.  This overly rich mix was way to much for the small mushroom caps to stand up to.

My stuffed haddock entree was well cooked, but arrived cold under a similarly overwhelming sauce as the mushrooms above.  A good piece of fish, but alas, poorly executed.

The service is good and I think their intentions to do a good job with the food are real, but it always seems that our meals are never quite right. We keep going back however, waiting for the stars to align, but only if we have a discount offer.
For example, I ordered the Rudder Burger that was ordered medium. The burger had no pink in it at all and it was missing the bleu cheese (a key ingredient that makes the burger a âRudder Burgerâ). I know I could have returned it, but then I would sit there watching my wife eat waiting for my new burger, then she would watch me eat after it arrived. Considering my options, I would rather eat at the same time as my wife and live with the less than perfect meal.
I ordered blueberry pie, without ice cream, for dessert. The last time I ordered it, it was so hot I had to wait 15 minutes to let it cool down from scalding to just plain hot before I could it eat it (it was the longest 15 minutes of my life).

Their tartar sauce has a strong horseradish taste, and the seafood tasted kind of like old oil. I would recommend the Muddy Rudder because it has a very nice and relaxing atmosphere, a nice view, and I think I just got a dud.

Pork chop dish was similarly poorly cooked: dry and tasteless meat, sauce was just OK.  One member of party ordered steamed lobster - it was grilled.  A medium rare steak came out cut in  Cabernet-colored medallions, which I would call aggressively rare.

A great melding of flavors and greatly enjoyed by both of us.  20 Milk Street does a very good job of presenting creative dishes with reasonable portions that make the dining experience well worth the money.  To us, too many restaurants today try to emphasize the ""creativity"" of their chefs while presenting their food in small plates to be shared with those plates being too small and expensive and not worth the money.

Sadly our meal took over two hours (the wait between the appetizers and dinner was an hour!!), our main courses came out over cooked (ordered medium sirloin got well done) and when I asked for a take home (didnât eat the steak it was so bad and was going to give it to my dog) the server forgot.

10746,4,4,4,4,"Busy Saturday summer evening in Portland, but Twenty Milk St. was quiet. They were seating people outside in the little garden adjacent to the main entrance of the hotel and apparently had decided not to serve in the dining room. When I booked, there was no mention of outside dining and since I am not a fan, I was happy to see that staff did decide to open up the dining room. We made reservations for 7pm and we had the restaurant to ourselves until three other parties came in around 8pm. Loved how we could chat in normal voices all evening even after other people were seated--felt like a pleasant little oasis in the midst of Saturday night's bustle and booked-solid status at many other restaurants across the city. 
While the menu had limited entrees, each of the four of us chose something different: gnocchi, chicken, seafood and steak. Everyone seemed very happy with the dinners. There were quite a few appetizer choices, a couple of specials, and a nice dessert menu as well.
Service was good, but we had to ask for bread. I'm glad we did because we were given an entire round loaf of warm bread that was excellent. Butter was soft for spreading, but only three small piped pats came with the bread. I would have liked at least twice as much. I ordered the filet mignon and it was a substantial portion, arriving a bit overcooked around the perimeter, but the center was close enough to the medium I ordered that I was pleased--it was an excellent filet, well-seasoned and wonderfully tender. We also had to ask for drink refills. 
Our waiter was just a tad inattentive, but pleasant enough and  unobtrusive, always coming to the table and waiting patiently for our conversation to end and our attention turn to him, before he spoke.
The bill came to $250 (not including tip) for 2 appetizers, 4 entrees, 3 desserts and 3 non-alcoholic drinks.
Valet parking was great, although there is a public parking garage close by.

The Garden Cafe is adjacent to the hotel driveway, and not as charming as they build it up to be.  The food was fair.  I had a watermelon tomato salad that was nice but perfunctory.  And the Tomato Gnocchi was horrible.  Floppy pieces of coral-colored dough thrown in the water by someone who didn't care about gnocchi.  It was really sad looking.

This restaurant was rated 4.2 and I thought it would be the perfect place to have dinner. Wrong... Three of us order the Piedmontese filet and all three were not cooked to our request. Mine was medium rare, the other was rare and the last one was medium. All three were over cooked. What a waste of a great steak. Another person ordered the baked stuffed lobster tails and after weeding through all the breading the lobster was under cooked and watery. It was disgusting. The waiter apologized and asked if we wanted to order another steak or something else. Obviously we did not. The Chef never came to the table to discuss the situation. The only people in the restaurant was one other table that two people were sitting at so there was no excuse for the entrees not to be done to perfection. The waiter finally agreed to remove all four entrees from out bill. We left him a $75 tip as we felt that it wasn't his fault the Chef can't prepare five entrees.

We sat at the chefs table / kitchen counter and had one of the most memorable experiences in a Portland restaurant. Chef David and his son Kyle worked together beautifully without having to say a word! My husband and I were mesmerized by the way they moved around in such small quarters. I can appreciate this immensely, as I am a private/personal chef, who never knows what kind of kitchen Iâm walking into until I arrive. 
Having Chef David serve each and every course to use was such a wonderfully detailed touch. He described each dish with passion, educating each guest he served. Although it was Restauarant week, and a lower price point than usual, Chef David still created a menu that absolutely wowâd us. It wasnât just dinner, it was an entire culinary experience that all chefs can appreciate.
 Often times you see chefs stressed out in the kitchen, irritated with one thing or another, bothered by guests or servers - but not here. Not one bit. He goes above and beyond to make sure his guests are happy, took time to chat and get to know my husband and I... we seriously felt like we had a private chef of our own for the night!  
Service was great, cocktails were delicious and the wine pairing was on point.

We all decided on wine pairing and the wine was just ok, middle of the road variety that did nothing to make me say wow even once. I must say that the amount of wine with each dish was very generous but i wish they had given less of something better.

With 2 less courses and minus a drink to linger over, dinner was much shorter than I had planned. I was planning to be at Opus for two and a half hours minimum. I also should say that there was an exceptionally large party which I'm sure skewed the pace of the evening. Overall it's hard to say anything bad about this place.

Depending on how big your appetite,  2 to 4 items should be expected.  My wife loved the scallop so much, she ended up ordering it twice.
Only small negative is you pay for a serving of bread that is replenished but is for 1.  Two people? Two items. One for each. They don't necessarily strictly enforce it, but it is on the menu that way and if you both reply yes for the bread, you will be billed twice. 
Considering the price of the items, and that you will be ordering multiple items,  just seems to be a way to add to the profit.

The service was great as well.  They provided any and all information requested, and did so with humor and patience.

First, we arrived a little early for our reservation (found parking nearby) and we were asked to wait in the front room with no space at the bar and nowhere to sit.  Then we were led through the bustling, happy scene of the front to a windowless room in the back.  The room had been a largish coal bin with the coal delivery window merely  boarded over.  The conversion existed of adding a few tables, draping some cheap gauzy fabric in swags from the low ceiling, and adding a tiny kitchenette to a corner.  Though we'd had to wait 20 minutes, there were only 2 other couples in the dark, dingy space.  Not romantic, just dingy.  The rather mediocre food was served a by what must have been a first year acting student just learning her lines. Each tiny portion was described in detail, but  she could not remember to leave off the hated truffle oil. When the stinky dish arrived from the kitchen (elsewhere) and was sent back, we watched while the person in the kitchenette pushed off the truffle oiled salad on top of what-ever-it-was, replaced it with new greens and the server returned it.  Guess what still stank of truffle oil?  Moaning and grumbling the kitchenette guy went to get a new dish. We were amazed at the entire performance. Nothing was good, just verbosely described. The wine (more descriptions) pours were a couple of tablespoons at most and poured so slowly that they may have partially evaporated by the time she was done. We've dined at Michelin 3-stars and know what exceptional food and service are like.  This was a really bad joke!  An expensive bad joke.  And we wasted 1 out of 14 evenings in Portland on a bad joke. If this is David's ultimate, dream 'restaurant' we really don't want to know what his nightmares are like!  The whole experience was painful at the time, but in retrospect we see it as a Saturday Night Live performance and laugh.",Greater Boston,"Dined on September 16, 2014",David's Opus Ten,open_table

Two of us ordered the brownie sundae which was not good as the brownie was over cooked and extremely dry.

The restaurant has also started serving everything in bowlsâ¦.including a hamburger and French fries. Itâs not a good customer experience to have to eat with such a limited serving area.

The restaurant is missing the mark with the community as people want a decent, local place to go with simple fare at reasonable prices. We used to frequent the restaurant at least once a week but we will be hard pressed to return this season.",New York City,"Dined on July 30, 2023",Shade,open_table

It came exactly how the waitress described it, three haddock pieces dipped in batter and fried. This could  have been much better but the haddock pieces were really small and the batter was really thick. I would have rated the food 4 stars but I think you have to do better on the fish. Haddock is 8 bucks a pound at Shaws and a generous serving would have been 1/3 of a pound. But I am guessing my serving was 1/10 of a pound. Nice place and we liked the atmosphere and our waitress.

The chicken on the skewer was dry as was the crispy brussel sprout cauliflower dish.  My husband's Smash burger was medium well instead of medium rare. But all were still tasty. The lobster tostado was cute. Little circles of corn tortillas with small piles of lobster meat, some avocado spread and a radish slice.

She offered only bar or high top (which are in bar area) I quickly responded I reserved a standard table.  She quickly responded those were already reserved!!

She just shrugged her shoulders and said those tables were for parties of 4. I looked at all the high tops and they all had 4 seats at them.

11355,3,2,3,3,"Shade is very casual and the noise level can be fairly high, making it tough to converse without raising your voice.   The mezzo plate appetizer had a nice variety of items, but was delivered with three pita triangles.   Clearly a sharing kind of plate and we asked for more pita, or bread.  I think we got three more triangles, maybe four. There were two us dining.   I ordered a veggie burger - I was surprised to find it had been deep fried.   My guest ordered a chicken sandwich, it too was fried.   Along with our menus we received a wine list (single sheet of paper) that was described as their ""reserve wine list"".  Our mistake that we did not pay close attention to the prices of these reserved wines.  In this highly casual place (my entrÃ©e was $12), we ended up buying a half bottle of wine that cost $77!!  Never spent that much on wine in a restaurant in my life, and sure as heck didn't expect to do so in a place like this.  My glass and a half of wine was good, but certainly not great.  Our loss for not paying closer attention and I sure won't be going back. If you go, make sure you scrutinize the alcohol prices.",New York City,"Dined on August 7, 2019",Shade,open_table

They were very knowledgeable to answer all of our questions and Burt made excellent cocktails to start us off. my dad had a Manhattan and I had a Cucumber Martini (forgot the drink name, but it was delicious). We had Oysters to start, and was pleased to find that they were Mookie Blues, one my fave! Abby, the manager brought them over and took the time to check in and make sure we were being taken care of. We also had a lovely chat with her. Then we split the mussels app, and finished off with the Linguine with clams! All of the food was superb!

We sat at the table for 22 minutes.  No service at all.  We did order drinks and an appetizer.  Never came and we never saw the waitress again.  We left and had to walk out.  We searched and searched for any staff at all. To no avail.  Not sure where they hide at 7 pm during a busy dinner rush.  Awful.  No napkins.  No water.  No silverware.  And after to talking to many friends they all said the same exact thing about shade.  They wonât be back.  The service is horrendous.",Charleston,"Dined on July 17, 2019",Shade,open_table
